We \\nhave historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average revenue \\nper user (ARPU) (collectively, our \""Facebook metrics\"") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on \\nour other products. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we also report \\nour estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per \\nperson (ARPP) (collectively, our \""Family metrics\"") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, \\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \""Family\"" of products) during the applicable period of measurement. \\nWe believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one \\nof our products. As a result, over time we intend to report our Family metrics as key metrics in place of DAUs, MAUs, and \\nARPU in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable \\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile \\npopulations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also \\nsusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user \\nbase, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our \\nprocesses for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to \\nimprove their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical \\nmetrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such \\nadjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or \\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties \\ndue to differences in methodology.\\nFamily Metrics\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple \\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of \\nuser accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our \\nFamily metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \\nand WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our \\nFamily, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To \\ncalculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the \\nindividual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across \\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one \\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, \\nand inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics \\nprimarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family \\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide \\nMAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and \\nit is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, \\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes \\nor trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are \\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply \\nsignificant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within \\nindividual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and \\nuser names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our \\nproducts, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and \\nmay in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations \\nmay affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. \\nOur techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals \\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer \\ndata signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp \\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family \\nmetrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and \\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own \\nproduct decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations \\nwhile our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or \\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics \\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product \\nchanges, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match \\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution \\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \""violating\"" \\naccounts. We define \""violating\"" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our \\nterms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that approximately 3% of our \\nworldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of \\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and \\nbehaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have \\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or \\nmore violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have \\none account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product \\nchanges, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP \\nand MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely \\nof violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that \\nthe actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nThe numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not \\ninclude users on our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other \\nactivities on our Family products.\\nFacebook Metrics\\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \""duplicate\"" and \""false\"" accounts among our \\nMAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \""false\"" accounts \\ninto two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, \\nor non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under \\nour terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for \\npurposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on \\nan internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For \\nexample, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to \\nidentify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. \\nAny loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and \\nfalse accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data \\nsignals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and \\nmay improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to \\nmeasure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our \\nestimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our \\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the \\nPhilippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false \\naccounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a \\nresult of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries \\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=\""such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take \\nother actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and \\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts \\namong our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nThe numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include \\nusers on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, \\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\\nUser Geography\\nOur data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP \\naddress and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a \\nuser may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the \\nuser's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical \\nerrors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors. \\n6\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\""PART I\\nItem 1. Business \\nOverview\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our products, \\nincluding our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nWe build technology that helps people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging \\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual \\nreality (VR) headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the \\nworld around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences \\nranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our \\nproducts. Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build \\nthe metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social technology.\\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). For FoA, we generate \\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to \\nreach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads \\nthat can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. \\nRL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and content. Our products include: \\nFamily of Apps\\n• Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through News Feed, Stories, Groups,\\nWatch, Marketplace, Reels, Dating, and more.\\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can express themselves and push\\nculture forward through photos, video, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite\\nbusinesses.\\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, audio and video calls, and Rooms.\\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and\\nbusinesses around the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\\nReality Labs\\n• Reality Labs. Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected, anytime,\\nanywhere. Meta Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge VR hardware, software, and content. Facebook\\nPortal video calling devices help friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in\\nmeaningful ways.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies \\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that \\nsell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing \\nadvertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, \\ncompanies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable \\nmarketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google and YouTube), \\n7\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=\""Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, \\nengage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and \\nadvertising services, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with \\nour products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented \\nreality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other \\ncompanies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become \\nsubject to additional competition. \\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are \\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the \\nproduct experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases, and as we deepen our \\ninvestment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to expand. We make significant \\ninvestments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our \\nmarketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing \\nin both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. \\nSales and Operations \\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We \\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout \\nthe stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. \\nWe work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate in more than \\n80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to \\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\\nMarketing\\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with \\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to \\ninvest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world. \\nIntellectual Property \\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade \\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, \\nemployee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our \\nproprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe \\nthat our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We \\nbelieve the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation \\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our \\nbusiness, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our \\nbusiness. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, \\nbiometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, \\ndata retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other \\ncommunications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, \\ne-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws\\nregarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer\\nprotection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be\\nmore restrictive than those in the United States.\\n8\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=\""These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties \\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the \\napplication, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and \\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and \\ninconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in \\nwhich we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made \\navailable on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to \\nbe, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the \\nCommunications Decency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, \\nbusiness practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can \\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or \\nregions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and \\namong countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, \\nit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, \\nwhich could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for \\ndata transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the \\nEuropean Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard \\nContractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a \\npreliminary draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta \\nPlatforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data \\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the \\nUnited States should therefore be suspended. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of \\n2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely \\nupon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of \\nour most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and \\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new \\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business. For example, the GDPR includes operational requirements \\nfor companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those \\npreviously in place in the European Union, requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European \\nUnion privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as \\nwell as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and \\ndraft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the \\nGDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a \\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-\\ncompliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted \\nsimilar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in \\ntheir respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, and its successor, the \\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect in January 2023, also establish certain transparency rules and create new \\ndata privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive includes \\nadditional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. \\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our \\nadvertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both \\nthe federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our \\nbusiness. For example, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify \\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could \\npotentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of \\ndata across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering \\nor have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or \\nsimilar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory \\ndecisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising \\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\n9\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, \\nactions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly \\nin the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and \\ncompetition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations.

We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas, \\ninnovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other \\nareas to further our mission. \\nWe had a global workforce of 71,970 employees as of December 31, 2021, which represents a 23% year-over-year \\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we \\ncontinue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of \\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as \\nother functions to support our expected growth. \\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe. \\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the long \\nterm, we expect some personnel to continue to transition to working remotely on a regular basis. We offer most of our full-\\ntime employees the option to work remotely on a regular basis.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are core to our work at Meta. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where \\nwe can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global \\ncommunity we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\\nAs part of our diversity and inclusion report, we publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity \\nworkforce data annually. As of June 30, 2021, our global employee base was comprised of 36.7% females and 63.3% males, \\nand our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 45.7% Asian, 39.1% White, 6.5% Hispanic, \\n4.4% Black, 3.9% two or more ethnicities, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and \\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).

We will also continue our ongoing efforts to increase \\nthe representation of women in leadership.\\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and \\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and hiring \\nmanagers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We have seen \\nsteady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this approach in 2015. We \\nalso continue to develop inclusive internship programs, and Meta University, our training program for college freshmen and \\nsophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to promote participation by \\npeople from underrepresented groups.

Our \\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and \\nengaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that \\nour active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases. In \\naddition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user \\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User \\ngrowth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as \\nTikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business \\nand macroeconomic conditions. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in \\nthe size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More \\nrecently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user \\ngrowth and engagement with any certainty, and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility. In the fourth quarter of \\n2021, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the total number of DAUs on Facebook, as well as a \\nslight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. Any \\nfuture declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our \\nfinancial performance.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain \\nusers or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking \\ncompanies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some \\ncases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement \\nlevels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly \\nas we introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, \\nand engagement, including if:\\n• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\\n• we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or\\nservices, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\\n• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency,\\n13\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 14},

have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying \\ndegrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-\\ngenerating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any \\nsignificant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and \\ndevelopers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, \\nour revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. As our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will \\nbecome increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to \\ndrive revenue growth.\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by \\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is \\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers \\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business \\nwith us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if \\nthey do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, \\nor if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our \\nuser data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely \\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable \\nreturn on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results \\nmay be harmed.\\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\\n• decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\\n• our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\\n• product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\\nproducts;\\n• our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\\n• our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\\n• changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,\\nincluding changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\\n15'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=\""• adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including\\ndevelopments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\\n• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, such\\nas our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging\\nproducts;\\n• reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the\\nsecurity and integrity of our platform;\\n• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties\\nthat demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\\n• loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors\\noffer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\\n• limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and\\nInstagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on\\nSCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n• changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks\\nrelated to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\\n• decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\\nmobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\\n• reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties,\\nquestions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal\\nliability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers\\nannounced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);\\n• the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads, including as a\\nresult of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with\\nthe GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, regulatory\\nactions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\\n• the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\\n• changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\\n• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\\n• changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\\n• the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The \\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce \\nthe prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively \\naffect our revenue and financial results.

Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate \\nthese signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example, legislative \\nand regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue \\nto impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt to \\ncontrol certain types of ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, which will increase further with expanded \\ncontrol over certain third-party data as part of our ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes \\nthat limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or \\nnew legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that \\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and \\nGoogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application \\ndevelopers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain \\nchanges to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other \\niOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to \\nnegatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, \\nwe have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such \\ndata signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and \\nour worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have \\nlimited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising \\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue in the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to \\ntargeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they \\ntake further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which \\nwould in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating \\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that \\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products \\nrather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating \\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating \\nsystems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with \\nmobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service \\nor policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give \\npreferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or \\ncharge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products \\nand monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the \\nuse of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, \\nand also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar \\nchanges to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the \\neffectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important \\nthat our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not \\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may \\nnot be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing \\nproducts that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards.

From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the \\noperation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect \\nour users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, \\nbrowser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the \\nanticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with \\nsuch third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business \\ncould be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, \\ntechnologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact \\nour user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our \\nbusiness and financial results.\\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.\\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to \\ncontinue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with \\ndevelopers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new \\nand unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating \\nexperience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented \\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and \\ntechnologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with \\nthese efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced \\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial \\nresults. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and \\nMessenger products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a \\nlimited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over \\nthe long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging \\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and \\nregulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, \\nor if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating \\nmargin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the \\nlong-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe \\nthat the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our \\nfinancial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to \\nour user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely \\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables \\nusers to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which \\nreduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our \\nNews Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the \\neffect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our \\nfinancial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product \\nand monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products \\nwhich may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their \\nincentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, \\nor introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more \\nproven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across \\nour family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or \\nmore products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as \\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed \\nor Stories products.

In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to \\nfocus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will \\ninvolve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in privacy, safety, and security efforts, and \\ncollaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in \\naccordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is \\nuncertain. In addition, we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality \\ntechnology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research \\nand product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or \\ndevelop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our \\nmetaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to \\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and \\nour ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, \\nas our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States \\nand international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the \\ndevelopment of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or \\notherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not be \\nsuccessful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers \\nmay be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that \\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new \\nusers are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to \\nprovide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new \\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the \\nactions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party \\nmobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We \\nwill also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, \\ndata use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or \\ndecisions in connection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the \\nfuture adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of \\nmedia, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company \\ndocuments relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, \\nas well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we \\nannounced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in \\nviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable \\ncontent on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise enforce our policies or address \\nuser concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be \\nnegatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users \\nacting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to \\nbe misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user \\ninformation for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services \\nfor illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United \\nStates and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent \\nOversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user \\nwell-being, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our \\ncommunity standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial \\ninvestments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding \\ndeveloper misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other \\ncontent, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future.

These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or \\nshutdowns in certain affected countries and regions, which have previously significantly impacted our business and results of \\noperations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the \\nslowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering. While our advertising revenue growth rate \\nimproved in subsequent quarters, there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the \\npandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic previously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online \\ncommerce, which in turn increased demand for our advertising services. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated \\nin many regions, and we may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the \\nextent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our \\nadvertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable \\nto predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the \\npandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\\n• volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a\\nresult of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\\n• delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\\n• increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices\\nor other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable\\nmaterial on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\\n20'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='• adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations\\non our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to\\nrely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform;\\n• significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange\\nrates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\\n• negative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\\n• illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and\\ndisruptions in our business; and\\n• increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial\\nstatements.\\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory \\nactions against us.

We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, \\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and \\ninformation online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet \\n(Google and YouTube), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. \\nWe compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or \\npaid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web \\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware \\nand virtual and augmented reality products and services.

Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial \\ncondition or results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the \\ncompanies we acquire.\\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have \\nsignificant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these \\nprocesses successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which has in \\nthe past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of \\nresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be \\nsuccessful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the \\ntransaction and our business may be harmed.\\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption \\nin our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of \\nusers and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our \\nproducts and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, \\ninterruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately \\ndesigned or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could \\nbe harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as \\nquickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be \\ndisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to \\nvarying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a combination of an error and a bug resulted in an \\napproximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products \\ncontinue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal \\noperational demands continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network \\ncapacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale \\nand grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user \\nengagement and advertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures \\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, \\nother physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in certain types \\nof natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject \\nto service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely \\nmanner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the \\nfuture be, subject to increased energy or other costs to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection \\nwith any such events.\\nIn 2020, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our \\ntechnical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate any such demands in the future, including as a result of our \\nreduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services \\n26'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm \\nour business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little \\ncontrol over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Due to the effects \\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply and labor shortages and other \\ndisruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes \\nto our procurement practices, and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services \\nfrom third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on \\nunfavorable terms. \\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require \\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business \\nand financial results. \\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we \\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data \\ncenters, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is \\ncomplex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets that expose us to \\nincreased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, \\nand may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated \\ndelays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions \\nof such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other \\ngeopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead \\nto increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of \\nour products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that \\nare not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have \\nstarted to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, \\nmuch of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and it is possible that action by a foreign \\ngovernment, or our response to such government action, could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical \\ninfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative \\nuser experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our \\nbusiness.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person \\n(ARPP)) and Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal \\ncompany data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable \\nestimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our \\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics \\nrequire significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually \\nseeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our \\nmethodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover \\ninaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical \\nmetrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to \\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family \\nmetrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below. \\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties \\ndue to differences in methodology.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple \\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of \\nuser accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our \\nFamily metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \\n27'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our \\nFamily, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To \\ncalculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the \\nindividual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across \\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one \\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, \\nand inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics \\nprimarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family \\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide \\nMAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and \\nit is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, \\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes \\nor trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are \\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply \\nsignificant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within \\nindividual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and \\nuser names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our \\nproducts, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and \\nmay in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations \\nmay affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. \\nOur techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals \\nfor some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer \\ndata signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp \\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family \\nmetrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and \\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own \\nproduct decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations \\nwhile our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or \\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics \\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product \\nchanges, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match \\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution \\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \""violating\"" \\naccounts. We define \""violating\"" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our \\nterms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that approximately 3% of our \\nworldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of \\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and \\nbehaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have \\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or \\nmore violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have \\none account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product \\nchanges, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP \\nand MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely \\nof violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that \\nthe actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \""duplicate\"" and \""false\"" accounts among \\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \""false\"" \\naccounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, \\norganization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal \\nprofile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to \\nbe used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts \\n28'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=\""are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this \\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user \\nnames, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to \\nthe reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, \\nactions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel \\nwork remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of \\nduplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application \\nof new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false \\naccounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very \\ndifficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary \\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our \\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the \\nPhilippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false \\naccounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a \\nresult of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries \\nsuch as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take \\nother actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and \\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts \\namong our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-\\nprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate \\nnumber of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not \\nbe complete.\\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as \\nthe user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. \\nFor example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to \\nrather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm \\nor other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these \\nfactors. \\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to \\nthe reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics \\nand estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also \\nchange from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of \\naccess to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, \\nsubject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. \\nWhere marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover \\nmaterial inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers \\nand developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which \\ncould negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number \\nof employees increasing to 71,970 as of December 31, 2021 from 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, and we expect headcount \\ngrowth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors \\nto continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as other functions to support our \\nexpected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, \\noperational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other \\nthird parties. As our operations and the number of our third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology \\nsystems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of \\nour management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not \\n29\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='be able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as \\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact \\nproductivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some personnel \\ntransition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired personnel \\nwhen our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment; \\nimprove our operational, financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our \\npersonnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement more complex organizational \\nmanagement structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our \\nability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more \\nlimited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our \\nfinancial results.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business \\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, \\nand we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international markets where we \\nhave limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available \\nglobally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory \\ncomplexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational \\nfunctions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, \\nour business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\\n• political, social, or economic instability;\\n• risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety,\\nlicensing, and infrastructure matters;\\n• potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\\n• enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\\nlanguages and countries;\\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\\n• foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\\n• higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n• enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\\n• burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\\n• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\\n• difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal\\ncompliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel\\nworking remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n• compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\\n30'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=\""• geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable \\nto us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage our obligations to \\ncomply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions, including \\nregulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.

For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the \\nfuture may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software used in the \\nproducts. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Our \\nbrand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers' \\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer \\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and the \\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. \\nWe could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on \\nreasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, \\nmanufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such \\narrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be \\nnegatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments \\nthat subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.\\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and \\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and \\nbusiness ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws, fails to implement \\nchanges in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-\\ncompliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our \\nreputation.\\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in \\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and \\nconsumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. \\nThe demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the \\ndate of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer \\nhardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the \\nconsumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product \\nor enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or \\ncomponent selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may \\nrequire significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable.

Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer \\nbase, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-\\nuser or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to additional \\nclass action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, biometrics, content, algorithms, employment, \\nactivities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer \\nhardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are \\ncurrently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the \\nmisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the \\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as \\nother alleged anticompetitive conduct; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents \\nbeginning in September 2021. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any \\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable \\nchanges to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could \\nbe materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit \\nis costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may \\nresult in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary \\ndamages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the past and \\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and \\nintercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use \\nour intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, \\nincluding the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are \\naggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We \\nare subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with \\ncertain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany \\narrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase \\nthe amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash \\nflows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign \\nsubsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's \\nposition and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may \\nadversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment \\nby management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income \\ntaxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to \\nsuch operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of \\nour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial \\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, \\nchanges in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or \\naccounting principles.\\n32\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be \\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could \\nmaterially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \\n(Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth \\nquarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or \\nCongressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact \\nour effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many \\ncountries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could \\nsignificantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in \\nwhich we operate our business.\\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base \\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under \\nwhich our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business.

Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued \\nproposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals \\ninclude changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of \\nnon-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or \\nenacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, \\nand which apply to our business.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax \\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that \\ncertain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in \\nchanges to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. \\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the \\ntaxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income \\ntaxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also \\napply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our \\nfinancial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from \\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in \\nthat period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. For example, in 2021, excess tax \\nbenefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.13 billion and our \\neffective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our \\nstock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may \\nincrease. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also \\naffect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on \\nour stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate \\nand adversely affect our financial results.\\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value \\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at the \\nreporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss \\nequal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be \\nrequired to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill \\n33'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the \\nfuture, could harm our business.\\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and \\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the \\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and \\nsystems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as \\nwell as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an \\nadverse effect on our business.\\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain \\nour competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the \\nforeseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel, particularly for \\nengineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the \\nincentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as \\neffective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, \\nwe would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders \\nwould be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price \\nvolatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may \\nnegatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. If we do not succeed in \\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to \\ngrow effectively.\\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our \\noutstanding capital stock.\\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the \\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our \\nstockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all \\nof our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all \\nor substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the \\nconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also \\ndiscourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the \\nClass B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the \\nability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and \\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of \\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board \\nmember and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he \\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, \\nMr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, \\nin his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term \\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish \\nour cash reserves.\\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the \\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our \\nClass A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term \\nstockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a \\ntermination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish \\nour cash reserves.\\n34'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate \\ncontent on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could \\nsubstantially harm our business and financial results.\\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in \\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may \\naffect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user \\naccess to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and \\nNorth Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they \\nconsider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have \\nbeen restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a \\nNational Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, \\nand suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In \\naddition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a \\nresult of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. It is also possible that \\ngovernment authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to our \\nconsumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number \\nof resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that \\nreduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in \\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action \\nagainst us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are \\nfound to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government \\ncould take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our \\nproducts. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is \\nrestricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other \\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or \\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to \\nretain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may \\nnot be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and \\ndata protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws \\nand regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products \\nand business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or \\notherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our \\nbusiness, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, \\ncontent, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization \\nand storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of \\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other \\ntrade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online \\npayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that \\nwe may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, \\nprivacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be \\nmore restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties \\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the \\napplication, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and \\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and \\ninconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in \\nwhich we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and \\nengagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\\n35'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content=\""We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can \\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or \\nregions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the European Union \\nand United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called \\nthe Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union \\n(CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses \\n(SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a \\nbasis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data \\nProtection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on \\nSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft \\ndecision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European \\nuser data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the \\nEuropean Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of \\nthis IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. In May 2021, the court rejected \\nMeta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a final decision in \\nthis inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we \\nare unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United \\nStates, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and \\nInstagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of \\noperations. In addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding \\nthe August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta \\nproducts and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India, and also became subject to \\ngovernment inquiries and lawsuits regarding the 2021 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy. If we are \\nunable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing \\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our \\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new \\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number \\nof product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), \\nand may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach \\nnotifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance \\nwith the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its \\ninterpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European \\nprivacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome \\nof such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of \\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other \\ncountries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and \\nservices offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in \\nJanuary 2020, and its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will take effect in January 2023, also \\nestablish certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain \\nsensitive personal information and more ability for users to control how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and \\nregulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of \\nadvertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising \\nbusiness. For example, regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the \\nuse of cookies and similar technologies. In addition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional \\nlimitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to \\nour products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. \\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state \\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For \\nexample, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the \\nUnited States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially impose new \\nrestrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, \\nmergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering or have passed \\nlegislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar \\n36\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content=\""requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory decisions \\nthat restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services \\nor our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government \\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, \\ndelays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating \\ncosts, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders \\nthat we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we \\nexpect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur \\nsubstantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. \\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with \\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the \\nsubject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, \\nand around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, \\ncontent moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and \\nmay in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and \\nconsumer protection authorities in the European Union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or \\nadministrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other \\nauthorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and \\nother government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data \\npractices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms \\nand policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was \\napproved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to \\npay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. \\nThe state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. Beginning in \\nSeptember 2018, we also became subject to IDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-\\nattack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from \\nuser accounts on Facebook. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain \\nother personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other \\nEuropean regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. \\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition \\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with \\nrespect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other \\nthings, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or \\nonline applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened \\nan antitrust investigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of \\nantitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December \\n2020, we also became subject to lawsuits by the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the \\nDistrict of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including \\nby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other \\nthings. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged \\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. \\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating \\nto allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us \\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary \\nremedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in \\nnegative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or \\nsubject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of \\n37\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and \\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and \\nany compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified \\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, \\nsuch as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in \\nconnection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent \\noperational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a \\nprocess to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy \\nprogram by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain \\nand enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require \\nsignificant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical \\ninfrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, \\nan adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business \\npractices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a \\nresult, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will \\ncontinue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant \\ntime and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other \\nprivacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant \\nauthorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and \\nwe expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy \\nrequirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to \\nsuccessfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other \\nregulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable \\nrequirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant \\nmonetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business \\npractices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our \\nproducts or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us \\nto change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or \\nmade available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. \\nIn particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news \\nhoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws \\nregulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. \\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party \\nactions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in \\nApril 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for \\ncopyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing \\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply \\nto online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United States, there have \\nbeen, and continue to be, various legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available \\nto online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online \\nplatforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our \\ncurrent protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur \\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face \\nfines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result \\nof content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in \\nthe future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement \\ncooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin \\nAmerica are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines, \\n38'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content=\""service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, \\nwe have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in \\nRussia and Turkey. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our \\nproducts or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in \\ncertain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations \\nfor copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make \\nsubstantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may \\nalso require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our compliance costs may significantly increase as a result of the \\nDigital Services Act proposed in the European Union, which is expected to take effect in 2023, and other content-related \\nlegislative developments such as online safety bills in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, changes to \\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or \\nrequire significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and \\nengagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and \\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital \\ngoods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make \\ndonations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the \\nUnited States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, \\nmoney transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, \\nconsumer protection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our \\nPayments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, \\nbanking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To \\nincrease flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain \\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us \\nto demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and \\nregulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In \\nthe event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary \\nfines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could \\nhave an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased \\ncosts and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; \\npotential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third parties; restrictions on the \\ninvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also \\nlaunched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and \\nservices, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\\nOur digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our \\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\\nWe are pursuing digital payments initiatives, such as Novi, a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a standalone \\napplication and subsequently integrated in other Meta products. These initiatives may use blockchain-based assets, such as \\nthe USDP stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is being used in a Novi pilot program in the United States and \\nGuatemala beginning in October 2021. Our future initiatives to support commerce in the metaverse also may use blockchain-\\nbased assets in digital payments. Use of blockchain-based assets in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology, \\nand the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving. These digital payments efforts have drawn \\nsignificant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. We are \\nparticipating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators related to our digital payments initiatives, and \\nadverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our \\nreputation and harm our business.\\nAs our digital payments initiatives evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States \\nand international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, virtual currency, anti-money \\n39\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content=\""laundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, data protection, tax, consumer protection, and competition. In many \\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with respect to evolving \\nlaws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. In addition, Novi has also received state money \\ntransmitter licenses in the United States, with more pending approval, and has other financial services license applications \\npending in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in those countries. These licenses, \\nlaws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the development of digital \\npayments products and services we offer, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or \\notherwise harm our business.\\nIn addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, \\nthere can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer will be made available in a timely manner, or \\nat all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may adversely affect our ability \\nto successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services. We will also incur increased costs in \\nconnection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our \\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our \\nsystems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to \\ndisrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission \\nof a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our \\ndata or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information from marketers, \\ncould result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business \\nand reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as \\nspear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems \\nin the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable \\nuser accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, \\nor other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data \\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and \\nemerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from \\nnation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable \\nactivity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the \\nservices we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, \\nimpair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we \\nreceive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other \\ntechnical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our \\nvendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities \\nor technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce \\nemployees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to \\nevolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have \\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable \\nundesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that \\nsuch measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts \\nwill be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the \\nsecurity of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may \\nreceive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products. \\nWe provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if these third \\nparties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, \\nour data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. \\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur \\n40\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content=\""significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and \\nregulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as obligations under our \\nmodified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory \\nactions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, \\nwhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or \\nconsent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may \\nalso result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse \\neffect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a \\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from \\napproximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish \\nData Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and \\ncosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or \\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional \\ninstances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, \\nsecurity, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations \\nand audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of these efforts we have discovered and \\nannounced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other \\nundesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or \\ntechnical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, \\nchallenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation of resources to other \\nprojects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required \\nunder our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the \\npast, and may in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or \\npolicies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities \\nthat threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or \\nspreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any \\nsuch incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, \\nharm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects \\non our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory \\ninquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to \\nenhanced regulatory oversight.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or \\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely \\naffect our business.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or \\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal \\nsystems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of \\ndata. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or \\nvulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our \\nobjectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the \\ncode has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-\\nparty cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile \\ninformation from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the \\nsoftware and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future \\nlead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our \\nproducts to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or \\nenhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our \\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make \\n41\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='commitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to \\nerrors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, \\nbugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or \\nmitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our \\ncommitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our \\nreputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or \\nother remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be \\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with \\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade \\nsecret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have \\nfiled various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a significant \\nnumber of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications \\nfrom third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge \\nproprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, \\neffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our \\nbusiness. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent \\ninfringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can \\nbe no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our \\nbusiness. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other \\ntechnology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a \\nresult of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or \\ndisclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation \\nrisk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the \\nvalue of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our \\nproducts, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial \\nresults.\\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that \\nare expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial \\ncondition, or results of operations.\\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and \\ntrade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of \\nintellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \""non-practicing entities\"" that own patents and other intellectual \\nproperty rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. \\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not \\ncompeted, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-\\npracticing entities.\\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and \\nservices, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual \\nproperty lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of \\npatent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is \\ncostly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable \\nfinal outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or \\nprovisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some \\nor all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if \\nany litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be \\nreversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or \\npay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in \\nviolation of a third party\\'s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our \\noperating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or \\n42'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require \\nsignificant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user \\nexperience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and \\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution \\nof the disputes and litigation referred to above.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our \\nClass A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has \\nranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2021. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate \\nsignificantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these\\nprojections;\\n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities\\nanalysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n• additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\\n• investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\\n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the\\nlevel of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\\nour developers and competitors;\\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\\n• media coverage of our business and financial performance;\\n• lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\\n• adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content,\\nprivacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive\\nexternal events, or responses to these events.\\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue \\nto affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation \\n43'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data \\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; \\nand a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021. We may \\nexperience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial \\ncosts, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings \\nto finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to \\ndeclare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in \\nour Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of \\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or \\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. \\nStockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors \\nand their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the \\nten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock \\ncollectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all \\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of \\nall outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability \\nto influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common \\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The \\nconversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative \\nvoting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, \\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he \\ncould, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nOur status as a \""controlled company\"" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise \\nharm our stock price.\\nBecause we qualify as a \""controlled company\"" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we \\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation \\ncommittee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of \\ndirectors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly, \\nshould the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not \\nhave the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for \\nNasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some \\ninvestors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy \\ncontest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may \\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an \\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of \\ncontrol would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws \\ncontain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our\\n44'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n• we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\\nby written consent;\\n• only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to\\ncall a special meeting of stockholders;\\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters\\nbefore an annual meeting of stockholders;\\n• our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and\\nshares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\\n• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\\n45'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content=\""Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal \\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities \\nlaws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as \\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and \\nseeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief.

These \\ntwo actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California \\nwith the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, \\n2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. \\nOn November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On \\nAugust 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On \\nOctober 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20, \\n2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the \\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well \\nas the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission \\n(FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We \\nentered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required \\nus to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and \\noversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and \\ncould subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the \\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative \\naction was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty \\nand related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On \\nJuly 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, \\nasserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in \\nconnection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second \\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are \\nwithout merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the \\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to \\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory \\ncompliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily \\nconcluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of European user data does not \\nachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to \\nthe United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry \\nin a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020.

Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our \\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by \\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits \\nconcern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital \\nadvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by \\nthe FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint \\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and \\nunfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman \\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our \\nplatform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. \\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of \\nGuam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \\nalleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring \\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also \\nalleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and \\nattorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other \\nequitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our \\nmotions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC\\'s complaint with leave to \\namend and dismissing the attorneys general\\'s case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of \\nappeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, \\nwe filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s \\namended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States \\nagainst us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other \\nalleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on \\nbehalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On \\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe \\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or \\ninquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, \\ndivert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies \\nthat adversely affect our business.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices.

More recently, we believe this \\ngrowth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the \\nsecond half of 2021.

The preparation of these \\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, \\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and \\nassumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the \\ncircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels \\nof subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, \\nand the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the \\nassumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income \\ntaxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and \\nequipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our \\nconsolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For \\nfurther information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nin the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \""Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data\"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether \\nwe are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, \\nwe consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as \\nother indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. \\nThe assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of \\nrevenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income. \\nValuation of Equity Investments\\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, \\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require \\njudgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, \\ndistribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such \\nas, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In \\naddition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our \\ninvestee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value \\nadjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For \\nequity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering \\nevents for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial \\ncondition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; \\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach \\nand recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying \\nvalue. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding \\nperiod, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is \\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating \\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. \\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax \\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These \\nuncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate \\n60'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax \\ncredits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities \\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax \\npositions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will \\nnot be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance \\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that \\nthe final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \\nincome taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition \\nand operating results.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise \\nin the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate \\namounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, \\nand we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for \\ncomplying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other \\nauthorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With \\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a \\nliability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If \\nwe determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably \\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent \\nmaterial.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been \\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions \\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, \\nregulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has \\nchanged for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these \\nestimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where \\nwe operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing \\ndamages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted \\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union \\nprivacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to \\nsignificant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our \\nestimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. \\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or \\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more \\nof these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s estimates of losses, our results of operations \\nand financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and \\nestimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income \\nTaxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \""Financial Statements \\nand Supplementary Data\"" and Part I, Item 3, \""Legal Proceedings\"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional \\ninformation regarding these contingencies.\\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful \\nLives \\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible \\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values \\nof these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the \\nbusiness combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with \\nrespect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated \\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade \\nnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\\'s estimates of fair value are based \\n61'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual \\nresults may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our \\namortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-\\nlived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one \\nyear from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the \\ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded \\nto earnings.\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in \\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two \\nreporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been \\nidentified.\\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible \\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The \\nevaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of \\nother assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future \\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates \\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such \\nassets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are \\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated \\nuseful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but \\nmay differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, \\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption \\nfor any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the \\nrevised estimated useful life. \\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the \\nestimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The impact \\nfrom the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and \\napplying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the \\naccompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \""Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data\"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding changes in the estimated \\nuseful lives of our property and equipment.\\n62'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='Components of Results of Operations\\nRevenue \\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by \\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. \\nMarketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the \\nnumber of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. \\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are \\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of \\naction-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is \\nsubject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We \\ncalculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price \\npaid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue \\narrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. \\nOther revenue.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses \\nwhich include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who \\nare responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, and professional services. \\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses and \\npayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, \\nmarketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include \\nprofessional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.\\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which \\ninclude accruals for estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other \\nlegal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our \\nlegal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; other taxes, such \\nas digital services taxes, other tax levies, and gross receipts taxes; and professional services. \\n63'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='Results of Operations\\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year \\nended December 31, 2020.

In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as compared with a \\ndecrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly caused by a recovery from \\ndeclines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, \\noverall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products and in all regions in part due to the \\ncontinued growth of online commerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered increased by 10%, as compared with an \\napproximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in 2021 was driven by increases in users and the number \\nand frequency of ads displayed across our products.

If our stock price remains constant to the January 28, 2022 price, and \\nabsent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be \\nsimilar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and \\namortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax \\nAct). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due \\nto increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our \\neffective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities \\ncould be several billion dollars lower.\\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that \\nhave the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective \\ntax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon \\nthe specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in \\nsubsequent periods.\\nSee Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \""Financial \\nStatements and Supplementary Data\"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax \\ncontingencies.\\n69'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='Liquidity and Capital Resources\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from \\noperations.

Some of the limitations of FCF are:\\n• FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\\n• other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness\\nas comparative measures.\\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of \\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most \\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating \\nactivities (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2020 2019\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 57,683 $ 38,747 $ 36,314 \\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment (18,567) (15,115) (15,102) \\nLess: Principal payments on finance leases (677) (604) (552) \\nFree cash flow $ 38,439 $ 23,028 $ 20,660 \\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a \\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital \\nresources.\\n71'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='Contractual Obligations\\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. \\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and land.

These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either \\nvolume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately \\n$8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual \\nvolume purchased.\\nOur other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021. Due to \\nuncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we \\nare unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a \\nresult, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\\nContingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We \\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss \\ncan be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the \\nextent material.

Such matters \\nare inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity \\ninvestment risk.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the \\nU.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, \\nhave in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or \\nlosses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional \\ncurrency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, \\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict \\nthe effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, \\nand $105 million were recognized in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated \\nstatements of income. \\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash \\nequivalents and marketable securities.\\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money \\nmarket funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. \\nOur investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes \\nin U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market \\nvalue of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of \\n$714 million and $794 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and \\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if \\nwe sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the \\ncarrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies. \\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable \\nfair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less \\nany impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments \\nof the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering \\nevents for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial \\ncondition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant \\nevents and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily \\navailable market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including \\nrecent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could \\nresult in a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method \\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of \\n$6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, \\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements \\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"" and Part II, Item 7, \""Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\"" contained in \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n73'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content=\""Item 8.

Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \\nRedwood City, California \\nFebruary 2, 2022\\n78\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 79},

\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization and Description of Business \\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, \\nInc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. \\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The \\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer \\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have \\ncontrolling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All \\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments \\nthat affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the \\nbasis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other \\nsources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are \\nreasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not \\nlimited to, those related to revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation \\nof long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful \\nlives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable, fair value of financial \\ninstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about \\nactions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the \\nestimated average useful lives of selected cohorts of servers and network assets from three years to four years in prior years \\nas well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prior year changes individually or in aggregate did \\nnot have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of the 2021 changes was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share for the year \\nended December 31, 2021. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as \\nof the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount \\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. \\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\\n• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\\n• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\\n• determination of the transaction price;\\n• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\\n• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\n85\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='Revenue excludes sales and usage ‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass ‑through \\nagent.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party \\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with \\nadvertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken \\nby our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are \\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of \\naction-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising \\nrevenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is \\nevidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue \\ngenerated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and \\nfor those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and \\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration \\nwhen estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts \\nexpected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable \\nconsideration.\\nReality Labs Revenue\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and \\nwearables, and related software and content.  Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products  is transferred to \\ncustomers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to \\nin exchange for the products.\\nOther Revenue\\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from \\nvarious other sources.\\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\\nDeferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of \\nrevenue recognition, revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL products. \\nDeposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make purchases in games \\non our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable to the \\ndeveloper and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue and deposits balance for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2021 was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance \\nobligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue \\nbalance at the beginning of the period.\\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not \\nsignificant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are \\ndelivered to the customer.\\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded \\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\\n86'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content=\""We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length \\nof one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for \\nservices performed.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These \\ninclude expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from \\nservers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based \\ncompensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs \\nassociated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing \\ncustomer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.\\nContent Costs\\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to \\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available \\nfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not \\nmaterial to date.\\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are \\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be \\nmarketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is \\ntypically reached shortly before the release of such products.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the \\npreliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to \\nperform the function intended.\\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to \\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. \\nShare-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. \\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is \\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating \\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using \\nthe asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected \\nfuture consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as \\nfor loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to \\napply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We \\nrecognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\n87\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content=\""We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than \\nnot to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, \\nexpectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the \\nneed for a valuation allowance. \\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax \\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These \\nuncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate \\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an \\nassessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will \\nbe sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and \\npenalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make \\nadjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, \\nsuch as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is \\ndifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such \\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. \\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated \\nstatements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.99 billion, $2.26 billion, and $1.57 billion for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of \\n90 days or less from the date of purchase.\\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency \\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) \\ninvestments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS \\ninvestments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated \\nother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of \\nestimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. \\nAllowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income, net on our \\nconsolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other \\ncomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, \\n2021 and 2020 were not material. There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized \\ngains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest \\nand other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.\\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. \\nActual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify \\nthe overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\\nEquity Investments \\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable \\nfair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less \\nany impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the \\nsame issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other \\nincome, net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If \\n88\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content=\""indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the \\ninvestment to fair value. \\nIn addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of \\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nFair Value Measurements\\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are \\nrecognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that \\nwould be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at \\nthe measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be \\nrecorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-\\nbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks \\ninherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following \\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the \\nhierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices \\nfor identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by \\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market \\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy \\nbecause their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable \\nmarket inputs.\\nOur equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring \\nbasis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective equity \\ninvestment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a \\ncombination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. \\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential \\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and \\nallowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of \\nthe accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable \\nforecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected \\ncredit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable were immaterial. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost \\nless accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \\nassets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\\n89\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='The estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are \\ndescribed below: \\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\\nServers and network assets Four years\\nBuildings 25 to 30 years\\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Three to 20 years\\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the \\ncarrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset\\'s fair value is less than the carrying \\namount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years \\npresented. \\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially \\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents \\nthe best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due \\nto changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and \\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying \\namount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See \\nsection \""Use of Estimates\"" above for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and \\nnetwork assets.\\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support \\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is \\nrelated to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their \\nintended use.\\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost \\nand related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or \\ndisposal is reflected in income from operations.\\nLease Obligations\\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, land, colocations, network infrastructure, and \\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at \\ninception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for \\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and \\naccount for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent \\nescalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as \\nincurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio \\napproach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and \\nincludes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. \\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise \\nsuch options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-\\nbased, and market-based factors.\\n90'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information \\navailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a \\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease \\nliabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, \\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on \\na straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise \\nin the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate \\namounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, \\nand we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for \\ncomplying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other \\nauthorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With \\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a \\nliability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If \\nwe determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably \\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent \\nmaterial. \\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been \\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions \\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, \\nregulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has \\nchanged for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these \\nestimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where \\nwe operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing \\ndamages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted \\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union \\nprivacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can \\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our \\nestimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. \\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible \\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values \\nof these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the \\nbusiness combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization \\nexpense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible \\nassets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the \\nacquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to \\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-\\nrelated expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our \\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we \\nreassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level \\n91'), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content=\""annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a \\nreporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible \\nassets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other \\nassets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future \\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates \\nthat the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying \\namount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years \\npresented.\\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have \\na finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively \\nover its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible \\nassets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over \\nthe revised estimated useful life.\\nForeign Currency\\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial \\nstatements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates \\nof exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive \\nincome (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2021, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of \\ntax of $677 million and as of December 31, 2020, we had a cumulative translation gain, net of tax of $439 million. \\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional \\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of \\nincome. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $140 million, $129 million, and $105 million for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\\nCredit Risk and Concentration\\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash \\nequivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents consists of \\nmoney market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities consist of \\ninvestments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt \\nsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers.

Although we are vigorously \\ndefending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries \\nand investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to \\nthese matters could be material in the aggregate.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating \\nto a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our \\nalgorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable \\nactivity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in \\nfederal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in \\nconnection with the same matters. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory \\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our \\nlegal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in \\nparticular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We \\nbelieve we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we \\nintend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties. \\n102\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 103}, page_content=\""With respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular \\nbasis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we \\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With respect to the matters \\ndescribed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of \\npossible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that \\nthey may be material in the aggregate.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and \\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and government \\ninquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other \\njurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of \\nsocial networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our \\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our \\ncompany. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \\nalleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the \\nFederal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp \\nin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we \\nbecame the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, \\n2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of \\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining \\nconditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring \\nInstagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our \\ncompany's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of \\nInstagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and \\nattorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without \\nprejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, \\n2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On \\nJanuary 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have \\nalso been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes \\nof action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and \\nunspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the \\nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, \\nour motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending \\nthem. \\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The \\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by \\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or \\nregulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and \\ninvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and \\naccrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe \\nthere is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses \\nor any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, \\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. \\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is \\nremote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently \\nuncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's \\nestimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any \\nsuch outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 — Income Taxes.\\n103\""), Document(metadata={'source': './meta.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content=\""Indemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify \\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters.

Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS.

While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax \\nyear, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by \\nthe second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court \\nchallenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial \\nan adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March \\n2020 and a second session commenced in October 2021. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS \\nprevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up \\nto approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties \\nasserted. \\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through \\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments \\nrelated to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its \\nposition for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million \\nin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the \\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. \\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income \\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two \\nNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our \\nforeign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe \\nunder the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the \\nprovision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the \\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross \\nunrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are \\nsubject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized \\ntax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if \\nany, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nNote 15.

RIS\\nK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our\\n \\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\\nSTRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.\\nCompetition in the technology sector\\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose\\n \\nnarrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our\\n \\nbusinesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and\\n \\nfrequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices,\\n \\nand services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A\\n \\nwell-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate\\n \\ngrowth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from\\n \\nfirms that provide competing platforms.\\n•\\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services,\\n \\nhas succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint\\n \\ndevices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including\\n \\napplications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their\\n \\nvertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion\\n \\nof our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\\n•\\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms\\n \\ndeveloped for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including\\n \\nprice and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past\\n \\nwere performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of\\n \\nthese devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating\\n \\nsystems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing\\n \\nplatforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment\\n \\nmanufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\\n•\\nCompeting platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and\\n \\napplications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and\\n \\napplications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that\\n \\nthese applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application\\n \\nmarketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications\\n \\nmarketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model\\n \\nobjectives.\\n23'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nBusiness model competition\\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\\n•\\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based\\n \\nproprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software\\n \\nproducts through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many\\n \\nof our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\\n•\\nWe are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our consumer and\\n \\ncommercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant\\n \\ndevelopment and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our\\n \\ncustomers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\\n•\\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.\\n \\nAdvertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with\\n \\nour revenue-generating products.\\n•\\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source\\n \\nAI models,\\n \\nand earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and\\n \\ndevelopment for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for\\n \\nresearch and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\\n A growing part of our business involves cloud-based\\n \\nservices available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and\\n \\nproductivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors\\n \\nare rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices\\n \\nand form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain\\n \\nindustries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks.\\n \\nWe are devoting significant resources to\\n \\ndevelop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural\\n \\nand organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected\\n \\nto the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities,\\n \\nincluding AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure,\\n \\nAzure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will\\n \\nreduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas,\\n \\nincluding:\\n•\\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\\n•\\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs,\\n \\nsmartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\\n•\\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\\n•\\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them\\n \\nmeet their own compliance needs.\\n•\\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our\\n \\ncompetitors.\\n24'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational\\n \\nand technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we\\n \\nmay not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and\\n \\noperating income.\\nSome users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen\\n \\ncredentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service\\n \\nsuch as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse\\n \\nare not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage.\\nRISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\\n We will continue to make significant\\n \\ninvestments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system,\\n \\nMicrosoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on\\n \\ndeveloping new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services.\\n \\nWe also invest in the development and acquisition of a\\n \\nvariety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new\\n \\ntechnology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and\\n \\nmarketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of\\n \\nnew software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service,\\n \\nand distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable,\\n \\noperating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get\\n \\nengagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices\\n \\nacross our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public\\n \\nreaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems\\n \\nin creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\\n We expect to continue making acquisitions and\\n \\nentering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of\\n \\nZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in \\nMarch 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022\\n \\nwe announced a definitive agreement to acquire \\nActivision Blizzard\\n, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI\\n \\nstrategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance\\n \\nour business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we\\n \\nhave difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or\\n \\nthat announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it\\n \\nmay result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability\\n \\nto leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our\\n \\npolicies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from\\n \\nthese transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.\\n \\nThese events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\\n25'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\n We acquire\\n \\nother companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill\\n \\nor intangibles.

Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored\\n \\norganizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of\\n \\nmethods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware,\\n \\nsoftware, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering\\n \\ntechniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain\\n \\naccess to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.\\n \\nNation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or\\n \\nour partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or\\n \\norganizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely\\n \\nremove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or\\n \\nsystems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or\\n \\ncompromised supplier accounts or hardware.\\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully\\n \\ndefending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the\\n \\nenvironment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and\\n \\nsystems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and\\n \\nbusiness applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays,\\n \\ncompromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual\\n \\nproperty or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of\\n \\nattacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\\n \\nWe are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software\\n \\nprovider’s customers, including us, through software updates.\\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of\\n \\nsharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented\\n \\ntechnologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries.\\n \\nOur business policies and\\n \\ninternal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.\\n26'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data\\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-\\npremises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to\\n \\nothers. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our\\n \\ninfrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data.\\n \\nAdversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to\\n \\ncontinue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”)\\n \\nvulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any\\n \\nproduct can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the\\n \\nvulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers\\n \\nusing our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to\\n \\ncompromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may\\n \\nalso result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or\\n \\nservices. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make\\n \\nour products susceptible to cyberattacks.\\n \\nAdditionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new\\n \\nfield, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated\\n \\nsecurity threats from sophisticated adversaries.\\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many\\n \\nyears. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current\\n \\nsecurity advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely\\n \\nbecause a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’\\n \\nvulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still\\n \\nhave limited\\n \\ncapabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for\\n \\nthis wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these\\n \\nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our\\n \\ncustomers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are\\n \\nalso committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these\\n \\nattacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as\\n \\nExchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments.\\nDevelopment and deployment of defensive measures\\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more\\n \\nsecure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security\\n \\nvulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even\\n \\nwhen software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and\\n \\nprovide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the\\n \\nimpact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized\\n \\nrequirements to which we must engineer our products and services.\\n27'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1A\\n \\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or\\n \\nperceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead\\n \\ncustomers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also\\n \\nspend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and\\n \\nthird parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or\\n \\nmay fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our\\n \\nreputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that\\n \\neliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial\\n \\nobjectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security\\n \\nvulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or\\n \\nharm to our reputation or competitive position.\\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\\n As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of\\n \\nour cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of\\n \\nhigh-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the\\n \\nsecurity controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third\\n \\nparties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors\\n \\nstore and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper\\n \\ndisclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal\\n \\ndata, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process\\n \\npersonal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce\\n \\ncustomer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and\\n \\nappropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure.

We\\n \\nspend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle\\n \\nmore traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy,\\n \\nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies\\n \\ncould be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and\\n \\ngeopolitical disruptions.

Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity,\\n \\ninsufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user\\n \\nexperience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current\\n \\nand potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe may experience quality or supply problems.\\n Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and\\n \\nmarket are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and\\n \\nreputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing,\\n \\nor warranty repairs.\\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs\\n \\nand other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads.\\n \\nMany of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or\\n \\nreliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or\\n \\nremediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that\\n \\neliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\\nThere are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for\\n \\nhardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity\\n \\nconstraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies,\\n \\nresulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services.\\n \\nComponent shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue.

Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to\\n \\nevolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal\\n \\ndata from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data\\n \\ntransfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the\\n \\ntransfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost\\n \\nand complexity of delivering our products and services.\\n \\nIn addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or\\n \\nrelated to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data.

Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our\\n \\nproducts and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international\\n \\ncurrency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of\\n \\noperations.\\n \\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\\n Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining\\n \\ntalented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is\\n \\nextremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive,\\n \\nare important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration\\n \\nlaws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our\\n \\nresearch and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our\\n \\nability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term\\n \\nsuccess. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and\\n \\nexecution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less\\n \\nflexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S.\\n \\nand internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to\\n \\nform or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to\\n \\nrespond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\\n36'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='PART I\\nItem 1B, 2, 3, 4\\n \\nITEM 1B.

We strive to create\\n \\nlocal opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”),\\n \\nthat deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes,\\n \\ngrow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.\\n \\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting\\n \\nan array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant\\n \\nexpenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing,\\n \\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\\n•\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\\n•\\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\\n•\\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.\\n•\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\\n•\\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\\n•\\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\\n•\\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue decreased 25%.\\n•\\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\\n•\\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\\n•\\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\\n \\n•\\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\\nIndustry Trends\\n \\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to\\n \\nconceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of\\n \\nwhat is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and\\n \\nusers, industry trends, and competitive forces.\\n40'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and\\n \\ndevices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve\\n \\nrapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.\\n \\nAggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\\n \\nWe must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\\n \\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating\\n \\nmargins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving\\n \\nneeds of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable\\n \\nland, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are\\n \\nprimarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current\\n \\nvendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very\\n \\nfew qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\\n \\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We\\n \\ncompete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow\\n \\none’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in\\n \\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the\\n \\nU.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in\\n \\nstrategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”),\\n \\nwhich included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to\\n \\nlease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to\\n \\nthe Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key\\n \\nstrategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other\\n \\nareas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder\\n \\nof fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\nSeasonality\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by\\n \\ncorporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the\\n \\nvolume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\n \\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased\\n \\nefficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated\\n \\nuseful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year\\n \\n2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this\\n \\nchange in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and\\n \\ndiluted share.\\n41'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nReportable Segments\\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal\\n \\nComputing.

The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3\\n \\nbillion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to\\n \\nstock-based compensation.\\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible\\n \\nproperties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the\\n \\ncurrent tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from\\n \\nproducing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution\\n \\nof, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign\\n \\nincome before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before\\n \\nincome taxes was $35.9 billion.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its\\n \\n2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination.

We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on\\n \\nthe information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12\\n \\nmonths.\\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years\\n \\n1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.

Equity\\n \\ninvestments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate\\n \\nliquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and\\n \\nindividual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to\\n \\ndiversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income\\n \\nportfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is\\n \\ninsignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\\n \\nValuation\\n \\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial\\n \\ninstruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual\\n \\nfunds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar\\n \\nassets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2\\n \\ninvestments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed\\n \\nsecurities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable\\n \\ninputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\\n \\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted\\n \\nmarket price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a\\n \\nquoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in\\n \\nwhich the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments\\n \\nbased on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to\\n \\ndemonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure\\n \\nappropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and\\n \\nindependent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\\n \\nCash Flows\\n \\nCash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and\\n \\ncash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9\\n \\nbillion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset\\n \\nin part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion\\n \\ndecrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion\\n \\ndecrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\\n50'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nDebt Proceeds\\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.\\n \\nThe proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working\\n \\ncapital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.

We have not engaged in any related party transactions or\\n \\narrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\\n \\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\n \\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements\\n \\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical\\n \\naccounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial\\n \\ncondition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities,\\n \\ngoodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\\n \\n52'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nRevenue Recognition\\n \\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services\\n \\nare considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-\\nbased service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\\n \\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain\\n \\ncloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and\\n \\ncloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which\\n \\nthe cloud services are provided.\\n \\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP\"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate\\n \\nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a\\n \\nrange of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be\\n \\nallocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\\n \\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\\n \\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services\\n \\ndue to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of\\n \\nthe customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\n \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern\\n \\nof certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\n \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of\\n \\nour products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits\\n \\nare estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\\n \\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\\n \\nImpairment of Investment Securities\\n \\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other\\n \\nfactors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination\\n \\nrequires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative\\n \\nevidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and\\n \\nbusiness outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before\\n \\nrecovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the\\n \\ninvestment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\\n \\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is\\n \\nimpaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to\\n \\nestimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an\\n \\nimpairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\\n \\n53'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nGoodwill\\n \\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on\\n \\nan annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit\\n \\nlevel (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or\\n \\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances\\n \\ncould include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a\\n \\nsignificant portion of a reporting unit.\\n \\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to\\n \\nreporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is\\n \\nestimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future\\n \\ncash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which\\n \\ncash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\\n \\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other\\n \\nfactors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting\\n \\nunit.\\n \\nResearch and Development Costs\\n \\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been\\n \\nestablished for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to\\n \\ncustomers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological\\n \\nfeasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this\\n \\noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the\\n \\nproducts.\\n \\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\n \\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such\\n \\nas a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the\\n \\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of\\n \\nprobability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially\\n \\nimpact our consolidated financial statements.\\n54'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 54}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nIncome Taxes\\n \\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities\\n \\nand assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax\\n \\nbenefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based\\n \\non the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest\\n \\nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of\\n \\nincome tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax\\n \\npositions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our\\n \\nconsolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our\\n \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n \\nInventories\\n \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead\\n \\nrelated to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and\\n \\ntransportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our\\n \\ninventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing\\n \\nstrategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis\\n \\nthrough a charge to cost of revenue.\\n55'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 7\\n \\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.

Principles\\n \\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\\n \\nStates of America (“GAAP”).\\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on\\n \\nour consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\\n \\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have\\n \\nbeen eliminated.\\n \\nEstimates and Assumptions\\n \\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,\\n \\nand expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance\\n \\nobligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\\n \\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our\\n \\nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand\\n \\nfor, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of\\n \\nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of\\n \\nimpairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased\\n \\nefficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well\\n as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated\\n \\nuseful lives of both server and network equipment from \\nfour years\\n to \\nsix years\\n. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year\\n \\n2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this\\n \\nchange in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $\\n3.7\\n billion and net income of $\\n3.0\\n billion, or $\\n0.40\\n per both basic and\\n \\ndiluted share.\\nForeign Currencies\\n \\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated\\n \\nat average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive\\n \\nincome.\\n \\nRevenue\\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\\n \\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution\\n \\napplications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and\\n \\nentertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\\n \\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as\\n \\nOffice 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online\\n \\nadvertising and LinkedIn.\\n63'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to\\n \\nreceive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are\\n \\ngenerally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any\\n \\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\n \\nNature of Products and Services\\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers\\n \\nmay purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over\\n \\nwhich the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software\\n \\nis made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional\\n \\ncharge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA\\n \\nconveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and\\n \\nuse products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is\\n \\ngenerally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct\\n \\nperformance obligations that are satisfied over time.\\n \\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either\\n \\na subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period.\\n \\nRevenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the\\n \\ncustomer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual\\n \\ncomponents are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\\n \\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue\\n \\nhas been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\\n \\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system.\\n \\nIn these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time\\n \\nwhen ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\\n \\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\\nSignificant Judgments\\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services\\n \\nare considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-\\nbased service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\\n \\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain\\n \\ncloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and\\n \\ncloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which\\n \\nthe cloud services are provided.\\n64'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold\\n \\nseparately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate\\n \\nSSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative\\n \\nSSP of the various products and services.\\n \\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\\n \\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services\\n \\ndue to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of\\n \\nthe customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\n \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern\\n \\nof certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\n \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of\\n \\nour products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits\\n \\nare estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\\n \\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\\n \\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing,\\n \\nor unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the\\n \\nbeginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an\\n \\nunconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\\n \\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned\\n \\nrevenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage\\n \\nperiod. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions,\\n \\nXbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn\\n \\nthe revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\\n \\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the\\n \\nperiod.\\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\\n In instances where\\n \\nthe timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing\\n \\ncomponent. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and\\n \\nservices, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a\\n \\nsubscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue\\n \\nrecognized upfront.\\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $\\n4.5\\n billion and $\\n3.8\\n billion, respectively, and\\n \\nis included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $\\n5.3\\n billion and $\\n4.1\\n billion,\\n \\nrespectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated\\n \\nbalance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available\\n \\nevidence.\\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one\\n \\nyear. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were\\n \\nimmaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\n \\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have\\n \\nbeen one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we\\n \\nhave determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\\nCost of Revenue\\n \\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support\\n \\nservice centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive\\n \\ntraffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other \\nonline products and\\n \\nservices, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting\\n \\nservices; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives\\n \\nof the products.\\n \\n66'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nProduct Warranty\\n \\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For\\n \\nhardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge\\n \\nof specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which\\n \\nwe do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate\\n \\nthe costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the\\n \\nadequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\\n \\nResearch and Development\\n \\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses\\n \\nassociated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the\\n \\namortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development\\n \\nexpense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to\\n \\nproduction. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\\n \\nSales and Marketing\\n \\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses\\n \\nassociated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs\\n \\nare expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $\\n904\\n million\\n, $\\n1.5\\n billion, and $\\n1.5\\n billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\n \\nStock-Based Compensation\\n \\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value\\n \\non the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards\\n \\nis based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.\\n \\nWe measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and\\n \\nfor PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is\\n \\nrecognized in the period of purchase.\\nEmployee Severance\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately \\n10,000\\n jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year\\n \\n2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $\\n800\\n million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations\\n \\nas part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in\\n \\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note\\n \\n19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.\\nIncome Taxes\\n \\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses\\n \\nare not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income\\n \\ntaxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred\\n \\nincome taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\\n \\n67'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nFinancial Instruments\\nInvestments\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair\\n \\nvalues of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and\\n \\nremaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as\\n \\nshort-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current\\n \\noperations.\\n \\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair\\n \\nvalue, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market\\n \\ninformation or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general\\n \\nmarket conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ\\n \\na systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to\\n \\nthe financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to\\n \\nsell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new\\n \\ncost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are\\n \\nmeasured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the\\n \\nmeasurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the\\n \\nfair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\\n \\nDerivatives\\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a\\n \\nderivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\\n \\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and\\n \\nlosses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other\\n \\nincome (expense), net.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and\\n \\nsubsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components\\n \\nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\n \\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income\\n \\n(expense), net.\\n68'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nFair Value Measurements\\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in\\n \\nmeasuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest\\n \\nlevel input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\\n \\n•\\nLevel 1\\n – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S.\\n \\ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded\\n \\non exchanges.\\n \\n•\\nLevel 2\\n – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\\n \\nmarkets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable\\n \\nin the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these\\n \\nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest\\n \\nrate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial\\n \\npaper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\\n \\nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter\\n \\nforward, option, and swap contracts.\\n•\\nLevel 3\\n – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in\\n \\npricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and\\n \\ndiscounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and\\n \\ngoodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are\\n \\nsignificant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\\n \\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined\\n \\nbased on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash\\n \\nflow projections.\\n \\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\\nInventories\\n \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead\\n \\nrelated to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and\\n \\ntransportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our\\n \\ninventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of\\n \\nrevenue.\\n \\nProperty and Equipment\\n \\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated\\n \\nuseful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed\\n \\nor acquired for internal use, \\nthree  years\\n; computer equipment, \\ntwo\\n to \\nsix \\nyears\\n; buildings and improvements, \\nfive\\n to \\n15 years\\n; leasehold improvements,\\n \\nthree\\n to \\n20 years\\n; and furniture and equipment, \\none\\n to \\n10 years\\n. Land is not depreciated.\\n \\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current\\n \\nliabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current\\n \\nliabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\n \\n69'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising\\n \\nfrom the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over\\n \\nthe lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of\\n \\ninterest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any\\n \\nlease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain\\n \\nthat we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n \\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as\\n \\nvehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a\\n \\nportfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\\n \\nGoodwill\\n \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and\\n \\nbetween annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its\\n \\ncarrying value.\\n \\nIntangible Assets\\n \\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from\\n \\none\\n to \\n20 years\\n. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised\\n \\nestimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\\n \\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted\\n \\nEPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding\\n \\nduring the period using the treasury stock method.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of\\n \\nthese exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting\\n \\ntreatment.\\n \\nForeign Currencies\\n \\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize\\n \\nthe economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\\n \\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are\\n \\ndesignated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange\\n \\nforward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance\\n \\nsheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\\n \\nInterest Rate\\n \\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to\\n \\neffectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our\\n \\nfixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts.\\n \\nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\\nEquity\\n \\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These\\n \\ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\\nCredit\\n \\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit\\n \\nexposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are\\n \\nincluded in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\\n \\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to\\n \\nmaintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $\\n1.0\\n billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements,\\n \\nwe will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, our long-term\\n \\nunsecured debt rating was \\nAAA\\n, and cash investments were in excess of $\\n1.0\\n billion.

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services\\n \\nbusiness and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial\\n \\nproceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health\\n \\neffect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission\\n \\nguidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were\\n \\nmanufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing\\n \\naround emission guidelines.\\n \\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific\\n \\nmethodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The\\n \\ndefendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In\\n \\nOctober 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for\\n \\nfurther proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing\\n \\non general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts\\n \\nthat cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying.\\nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising\\n \\npractices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period\\n \\nof inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft\\n \\nintends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision.\\nOther Contingencies\\n \\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management\\n \\ncurrently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial\\n \\nstatements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.\\n \\nAs of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $\\n617\\n million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that\\n \\nwe estimate could reach approximately $\\n600\\n million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to\\n \\noccur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become\\n \\nreasonably estimable.\\n \\n88'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='PART II\\nItem 8\\n \\nNOTE 16 \\n—\\n STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\\n \\nShares Outstanding\\n \\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\\n \\n \\n(In millions)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nYear Ended June 30,\\n \\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBalance, beginning of year\\n \\n \\n7,464\\n7,519\\n7,571\\nIssued\\n \\n \\n37\\n40\\n49\\n \\nRepurchased\\n \\n \\n(\\n69\\n)\\n(\\n95\\n)\\n(\\n101\\n)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBalance, end of year\\n \\n \\n7,432\\n \\n7,464\\n7,519\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nShare Repurchases\\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $\\n40.0\\n billion in share repurchases.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\\n \\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\\n \\ncompany\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\\n \\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\\n \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\n \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\\n \\nof the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\\n \\nthe company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\\n \\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\\n \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n \\n/s/ D\\nELOITTE\\n & T\\nOUCHE\\n LLP\\n \\nSeattle, Washington\\nJuly 27, 2023\\n \\n100'), Document(metadata={'source': './microsoft.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='PART II, III\\nItem 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\n \\nITEM 9B.

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East andAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\\nCompany’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one ismanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographicregion.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. TheCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024,the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the\\nCompany’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\n®\\n®\\n® SM\\n® ®\\n®\\n® ®\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software andaccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as wellas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,\\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices andlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. TheCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, orcollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilizecustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until thesuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’srequirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfullydepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\\n(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. Thisincludes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Althoughthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued andregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products andservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by thirdparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the\\nCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could beobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to\\ncreate an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024,the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. TheCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness andtime away.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University onleadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical\\nand personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for allemployees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative workenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specificprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its teammembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Available Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant toSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently knownor unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should\\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions canmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s\\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside theU.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currencyfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. Inaddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,\\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions\\ncan have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channelpartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\\nand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financialinstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, naturaldisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents andother business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logisticsproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that itgenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls onimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularlysignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\\nsupply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, andcan require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer anddistribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new\\nor changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can beannounced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\nmeasures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting theCompany’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe andrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locationsthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring\\nmore frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurityattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and\\ngeopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the\\nCompany’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negativelyimpact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are\\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption tothe Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumerproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movementof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, andlose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business\\ninterruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certaintypes of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may beunable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\\ntechnologies to the marketplace.

There can be no assurance theseinvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in everycountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or ifcompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition inthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\\ncontent supplier relationships.

The success of new product and service introductionsdepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated withnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services,\\nthe effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriatequantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New\\nproducts, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materiallyadversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully managefuture introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which arelocated outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often\\nin single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operatingcosts, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future havean adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remainsresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from\\ntime to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to timeand can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have anegative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, ifthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted orterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposureto additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Manycomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductorindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered intoagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, orat all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a\\nparticular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, theCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of commoncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product\\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.

Sophisticated operating\\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation ofhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defectscould make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\\nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and fromtime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may\\nnot meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safetyrisks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detectand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.

The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changesin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities andgovernmental bodies.

Additionally, the Company, the technologyindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchasesits stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of futuregrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,\\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the“Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectationsrelated to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly,\\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.

Legal Proceedings\\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. TheCommission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for appsdistributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in theArticle 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigationagainst the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the\\nDMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% ofthe Company’s annual worldwide net sales.

The CaliforniaDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunctionenjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple\\nin-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented aplan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s complianceplan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\\nhowever, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protectagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\\nand term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, thatwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest RateSensitive Instrument Hypothetical InterestRate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenorsDecline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089 \\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenorsIncrease in annual interest expense$ 139 $ 194 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes inexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company maychoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreigncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\\none-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’sunderlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currencyderivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='Item 8.

For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’sServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period followingtransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on theCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determineSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considersmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, pricescharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\\nprovide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material\\nperformance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. TheCompany allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\\nobservable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to thedelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.\\nRevenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to beprovided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value ofthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489 \\nMac 29,984 29,357 40,177 \\niPad 26,694 28,300 29,292 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories 37,005 39,845 41,241 \\nServices 96,169 85,200 78,129 \\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenuerecognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included indeferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\\n® ®\\n(1)\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “SegmentInformation and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\\nsales.\\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively.

The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilizecustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’srequirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, SouthKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in theCompany’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographicregion.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally\\nbased on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segmentconsists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the\\nCompany’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 46'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\nAmericas:\\nNet sales $ 167,045 $ 162,560 $ 169,658 \\nOperating income $ 67,656 $ 60,508 $ 62,683 \\nEurope:\\nNet sales $ 101,328 $ 94,294 $ 95,118 \\nOperating income $ 41,790 $ 36,098 $ 35,233 \\nGreater China:\\nNet sales $ 66,952 $ 72,559 $ 74,200 \\nOperating income $ 27,082 $ 30,328 $ 31,153 \\nJapan:\\nNet sales $ 25,052 $ 24,257 $ 25,977 \\nOperating income $ 12,454 $ 11,888 $ 12,257 \\nRest of Asia Pacific:\\nNet sales $ 30,658 $ 29,615 $ 29,375 \\nOperating income $ 13,062 $ 12,066 $ 11,569 \\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\nSegment operating income $ 162,044 $ 150,888 $ 152,895 \\nResearch and development expense (31,370) (29,915) (26,251)\\nOther corporate expenses, net (7,458) (6,672) (7,207)\\nTotal operating income $ 123,216 $ 114,301 $ 119,437 \\n(1) Includes general and administrative compensation costs, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed costs.\\nThe following tables show net sales for 2024, 2023 and 2022 and long-lived assets as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for countries that\\nindividually accounted for 10% or more of the respective totals, as well as aggregate amounts for the remaining countries (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\nNet sales:\\nU.S. $ 142,196 $ 138,573 $ 147,859 \\nChina 66,952 72,559 74,200 \\nOther countries 181,887 172,153 172,269 \\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 \\n2024 2023\\nLong-lived assets:\\nU.S. $ 35,664 $ 33,276 \\nChina 4,797 5,778 \\nOther countries 5,219 4,661 \\nTotal long-lived assets $ 45,680 $ 43,715 \\n(1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\n(1)\\n (1)\\n(1)\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 47'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc.

A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 1, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='Item 9.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\\npolicies and procedures that: \\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s\\nassets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withGAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management\\nand directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets\\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provideabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act).

General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular\\nrestricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in\\nthe Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is\\nreferred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The\\nAward was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the\\n“Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the\\nAward.\\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\\nfor the determination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are\\nan unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and\\nExhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).\\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the\\nParticipant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an\\napproved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence,\\nin each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

Dividend and Voting Rights.\\n(a)    Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\\n(b)    Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award\\nthat are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to\\nthe foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the\\noriginal RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested\\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will\\ncorrespond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of\\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend,\\nhave either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\\n6.    Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\\n7.    Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs.

The\\nCompany’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person\\nentitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents\\nor assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are\\nsettled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\\n8.    Effect of Termination of Service. Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as\\nthe related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s\\nTermination of Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its\\nSubsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause,\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date\\nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash equivalent.

If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as\\nthe related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that\\nany RSUs remain outstanding following the Severance Date by reason of this Section 8, but the applicable performance-based vesting\\nconditions are not satisfied, such RSUs shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without\\npayment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal\\nrepresentative, as the case may be.\\n9.    Recoupment.

By accepting this Award, the Participant further\\nagrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order to comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the\\nextent that the terms of this Agreement and any Company recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail.

Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by\\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content=\""issued in respect of the Award.

This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior\\nunderstandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award\\nAgreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The\\nCompany may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not materially and adversely affect the\\ninterests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a\\nwaiver of any other provision hereof.\\n17.    Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This\\nAward Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to the RSUs and the settlement thereof and shall not be\\nconstrued as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the\\nrights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the settlement of RSUs, and rights no greater than the right to receive the\\nShares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when settled hereunder.\\n18.

This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.\\n22.    Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal\\nor otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\\n23.    Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s\\nparticipation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or\\nadvisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be\\nnecessary to accomplish the foregoing.\\n* * * * *\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='PERFORMANCE AWARD\\nEXHIBIT A\\nPERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS\\nThe RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on\\nthe Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.\\nThe percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:\\n• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs\\nwill vest on the Vesting Date.\\n• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on\\nthe Vesting Date.\\n• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on\\nthe Vesting Date.\\n• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the\\nVesting Date.\\nFor TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the RSUs that will vest\\non the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated\\nabove.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred\\npercent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.\\nThe number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the RSUs will not vest\\nand will terminate on that Vesting Date.\\n    For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:\\n• “TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members for\\nthe Performance Period.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\\n“Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted\\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms\\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\\nas the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\\ndetermination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an\\nunfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first\\nVesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award\\nAgreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the\\nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

Dividend and Voting Rights.\\n(a)    Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\\n(b)    Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that\\nare outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the\\nforegoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original\\nRSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend\\nEquivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to\\nany RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.\\n6.    Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\\n7.

The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent\\nthat the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any\\nrepresentations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan.

Effect of Termination of Service.\\n(a)    Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\\nEquivalent Rights) shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s\\nTermination of Service (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without\\ncause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a\\nVesting Date.\\n(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant’s\\nTermination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, any unvested\\nRSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall continue to be eligible to vest on a pro rata basis (in accordance\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)), without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service, determined by\\nmultiplying (i) the number of RSUs eligible to vest on the applicable Vesting Date, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of\\ndays that have elapsed between the Award Date and the Participant’s Retirement date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number\\nof days contained in the period between the Award Date and the applicable Vesting Date. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement”\\nmeans the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10)\\nyears of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by the Company) as of the Severance Date, as\\ndetermined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant’s Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of\\nthe Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion.

By accepting this Award, the Participant further agrees\\nto comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order to comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent\\nthat the terms of this Agreement and any Company recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is\\nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\\n10.    Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by\\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of\\nthe Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited\\npursuant to Section 5(b).\\n11.    Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant’s\\nemployer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s\\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\\nthe Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection\\nwith any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any\\nShares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no\\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or\\nachieve any particular tax result.

If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded\\nto the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek\\na refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number\\nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested\\nRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may\\nrefuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the\\nParticipant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\\n12.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is\\nreferred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The\\nAward was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the\\n“Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the\\nAward.\\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\\nfor the determination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement.

(The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).\\n4.    Continuance of Employment.

Employment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the\\nParticipant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an\\napproved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence,\\nin each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\\n(b)    Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award\\nthat are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”).

The Policy is\\nintended to comply with, and as applicable to be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the\\nexceptions set forth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule 10D-1 under the\\nExchange Act (collectively referred to herein as “Rule 10D-1”). For avoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered\\nExecutives who served as a Covered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any Incentive-\\nBased Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy explains when Apple will be required to\\nseek recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.\\nB.Incentive-Based Compensation\\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation granted, earned or vested based\\nin whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more financial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after\\nOctober 2, 2023 and (ii) by a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for\\nthe Incentive-Based Compensation.

For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation includes awards granted to a\\nCovered Executive that are outstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is\\n“Received” in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained regardless of when it is paid or\\nawarded.\\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested based on the attainment of one or\\nmore financial measures, including but not limited to time-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation\\nunder this Policy but may be recouped under the Apple Inc.

If the Incentive-Based Compensation is based on stock\\nprice or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting\\nRestatement, if any, on the stock price or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether\\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded.\\nIf the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered because recovery efforts are\\nexcessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the cost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to\\nlaws outside the United States, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a\\ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders’ best interests and should continue or would\\notherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': './aapl.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='If the Committee determines a Covered Executive Received erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, the\\nCommittee shall determine the timing and method of recovery in its sole direction and direct Apple to recover any\\nerroneously awarded amounts as soon as administratively practicable.

Our desktop gaming products\\ntypically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\\nManufacturing\\nWe utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process,\\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the InternationalOrganization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of\\nthe significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in theproduction of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials usedin the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods of\\ngrowth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums, or providedeposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.\\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term manufacturing capacity aligned with\\ngrowing customer demand. Our supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingCompany Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from Micron\\nTechnology, Inc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors andcontract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our finalproducts.\\n8'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=\""Table of Contents\\nCompetition\\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that theprincipal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, softwaresupport, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain\\ncompetitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able todeliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existingcompetitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by\\nour products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI\\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel,and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may bemore able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\\nOur current competitors include:\\n• suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including\\nsolutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\\n• large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing functionality as partof their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation,\\nor Microsoft;\\n• suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as\\nAmazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\\n• suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gamingdevices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung,\\nor companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\\n• networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as AMD,Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology\\nGroup as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements toprotect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2024 to August 2043. We havenumerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to\\nour products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP.The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products\\nor IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products morelikely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\\n• the location in which our products are manufactured;\\n• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\\n• the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\\n• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.\\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\\n9\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nGovernment Regulations\\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments.\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to\\nChina (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 orH100 integrated circuits.\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and otherregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of ourproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,including China.

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adverselyaffected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers willdemand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We\\ncannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key successcriteria, our financial results may be harmed.\\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which include cloud-basedinfrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partneredwith CSPs to host such software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to\\nsupport these offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue tochange, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources, andinvestment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other\\nsoftware solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. Wemay incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customerneeds, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling pricesfor our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more\\ncomprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Thesecompetitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets andend-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a\\nsupply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similarto some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete\\nwith our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Ifwe are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establishmeaningful revenue.\\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, componentand capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, aswe have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and\\nexcess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient\\n15'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Table of Contents\\ncommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our\\nproduct development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chaincomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not availablefrom third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply\\nor capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended leadtimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and\\nmay continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity,which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,\\nor otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\\n• changes in product development cycles and time to market;\\n• competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n• the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\\n• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n• new or unexpected end-use cases;\\n• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\\n• business decisions made by third parties;\\n• the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services;\\n• changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n• the demand for our products; or\\n• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications acrossseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply andcapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue toenter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\\nyear 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains verystrong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments ifour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions arecomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to shipand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AIopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long\\nmanufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory ofprior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experiencereduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\\n16'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content=\""Table of Contents\\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity ofnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or othercosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions andhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact oursupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, andother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our abilityto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we maynot be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and marketshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availabilityissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we maynot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we mayneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need tocontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of ourhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and maycontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatilityin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies,such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our\\nproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AImodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper\\nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur ifwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical toour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the futureimpact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began tobe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of\\ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including newcompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can furtherimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our\\n17\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nGPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products\\nmay be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplacescompete with our new products and distribution channels.\\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage ourplatforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure bydevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers\\nor publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affectcustomer demand.\\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over productquantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.\\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test, or package our\\nproducts, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, andproducts. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain,negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial\\nresults, including:\\n• lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly\\nestimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\\n• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for ourproducts;\\n• failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometryprocess technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;\\n• failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\\n• limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers and memorymanufacturers;\\n• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volumeproduction or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a supplier;\\n• lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\\n• suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\\n• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our\\ncompetitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\\n• requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\\n• low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and\\n• disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters andelectricity conservation efforts.\\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause usto lose market share.\\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities or\\nexperience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system.These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These risks\\nfurther increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct controlover production. AI software products we or our partners offer rely on\\n18'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Table of Contents\\ntraining data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors,or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally\\nremain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in thepast and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services couldresult in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that\\ncould attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which ourofferings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Anysuch defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of\\nrelated inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Ourefforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after\\ncommencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from aproduct or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would inturn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or\\nconsumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatoryagencies.\\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and otherdefects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods.We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty\\nobligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any ofour products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of\\ndefending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our businessliability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy,disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses,\\nincluding on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints andglobal economic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial\\nresults, including:\\n• increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past andmay do so in the future;\\n• increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduceour margins;\\n• decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\\n• the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customersand/or end users;\\n• limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\\n• the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing parties or other third parties we rely on;\\n• reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for bankruptcy protection and potentially ceaseoperations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to competeeffectively; and\\n• increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on ourcustomers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our\\nfinancial instruments.\\n19'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nAdverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to\\nmarket-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability tofulfill their contractual obligations to us, or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and\\ninterest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of ourinvestment portfolio comprises USG securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual or\\nthreatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverseconditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured,assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales\\noutside of the United States. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year2024. Although we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have started to ship alternatives to the China market insmall volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing\\nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number ofrisks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do\\nbusiness, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employmentpractices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations,\\nnatural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.\\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue,increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures,loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully\\ndetect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalentand severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is\\ndelayed or not feasible.\\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged\\nand are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinatedattacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightenedrisk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional\\nmisconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control\\nmechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive informationor adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there canbe no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party\\nsuppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology,employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties andinfrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or\\nbugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party informationtechnology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate third-party data into our AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our\\nalgorithms. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. We mayhave limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers\\nsuffers a security incident (which has happened in the\\n20'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Table of Contents\\npast and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and otherinformation related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if ourproducts or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm\\nour business.\\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected toresult in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed\\nto ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicableindustry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate\\ncertain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls,systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after asecurity incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.\\nThese vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures,\\nalong with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties,could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatoryinquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code\\nfrom third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk ofloss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on\\nexperience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverseconsequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation,indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our\\nsystems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders,delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Applicabledata privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of\\nsecurity incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties maygather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\\norganization and could be used to harm our business.\\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures,\\nsupplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatorydeterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity,\\nand a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some ofour suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring inthese geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research\\nand development systems and personnel. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical anddomestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or\\nadverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of ourproduct components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could\\nimpact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restrictedand may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and\\ncompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics orother operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology systemfailures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party\\nfoundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic eventaffects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses,and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and\\noperating results.\\n21'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operatingexpenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our\\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the regionhave been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others\\nmay continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense toour business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for ourbusiness.\\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including due to the eventsdescribed above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. Aswe increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages\\nand other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, orregulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and\\nservices.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and\\nreliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extremeheat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for\\nour Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impacton our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and ourvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we\\nmaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability andcost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not\\ncovered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulationsrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in\\ngreater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes,increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as\\nwell as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs andrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We\\nmay not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals.We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increasedlitigation and costs.\\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be negatively impacted by concernsaround the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing\\nplatforms.\\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrateacquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand orenhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop\\nnew products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit ourability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due todelays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the\\ntarget company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefitsof the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to\\nthe extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been\\n22'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nharmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our\\nresults and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further ourstrategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction.Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return.\\nTo the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Ourinvestment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We\\nface additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaininggovernmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or\\ninvestment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or areacquiring.\\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\\n• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including keypersonnel, of the acquired business;\\n• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\\n• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\\n• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\\n• stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close anacquisition;\\n• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants orother restrictions;\\n• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\\n• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\\n• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\\n• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\\n• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and\\ncostly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processeswith our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of\\noperations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales tocustomers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of\\nthese customers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one customer, Customer\\nA, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners,we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well asthe ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to\\nincorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase orderbasis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customersmay develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in\\nthe markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do notpurchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. One indirect customer which\\nprimarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the\\n23'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content=\""Table of Contents\\nCompute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators,distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of\\nour large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions or anydifficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit anddevelop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilledworkers and leaders, cost inflation and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or\\ninterpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-\\nbased compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effectivesuccession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and executionand long-term success.\\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of suchsystems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financialreporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support ourgrowth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system\\nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfullyoperate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose\\nsubstantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm ouroperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial\\nstatements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate anymaterial weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results\\non a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may besubject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities\\nanalysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on ourpast results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\\n• our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\\n• our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\\n• our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtaincredit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs;\\n• our vendors' payment requirements;\\n• unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\\n• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grantextended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors haverequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creatingvolatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is\\nlikely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility.\\n24\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions mayadversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;\\ntaxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controlsand cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;\\nenvironmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with suchrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability tomanufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws\\nor the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctionsagainst us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations\\nto which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or furtherrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a resultof changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\\nOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,the United Kingdom and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in thegraphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information\\nfrom regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and ourinvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in\\nthe future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundationmodels and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of newsystems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws\\nor regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties ortariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing\\nof our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact ourbusiness and results of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas orother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export\\nlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws orsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available\\nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales toRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of\\nenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\\ntuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire,deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of exportcontrol restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated\\n25'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negativelyimpact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad andcould negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,\\nwhich have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services eventhough competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financialresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products\\nto additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negativelyimpact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and\\ncustomers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside Chinaand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our\\nproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely toimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impactingour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serveoverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about oursales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulatorsconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions\\non our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and\\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated\\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There arealso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses inChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of ourproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply tothe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China andHong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distributionoperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products coveredby the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG\\nwill grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensomeconditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not haveclear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of\\nproducts to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions forcountries outside China. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\\n26'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='Table of Contents\\ndisadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for theirproducts.\\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitiveposition and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of thegeographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we\\nare unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses tosignificant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\\nburdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors,as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China topursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In theevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USGhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs ifcertain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands suchcontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of ourproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a widerrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and otherimpacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\\nserve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request thatour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,\\nLatin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by thetime a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase\\ninvestment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gamingrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions\\non the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinesegovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions onour products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions thatnegatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risksand adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and government regulators have focused\\nincreasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not besatisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the\\nU.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, oversightof our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder,\\n27'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nregulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards. We could also incuradditional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct businesswith potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand,\\nreputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harmand liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products andservices, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its\\nadoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutionsthat have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or\\nother social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development anduse of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complyingwith multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain\\njurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance withexisting and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in\\nresponse to the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reportingand/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify the USG of certain safetytest results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change\\nour business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsibleuse of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessfulor if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties\\nthat we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties,payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incursignificant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. Ifinfringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the\\nthird party’s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilitiesor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or crosslicense our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,\\nthe indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in\\nwhich we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility ofpiracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harmour competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and\\nmarketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seekformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage ourreputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external andinternal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimateuse of our products and services with regard\\n28'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could\\ndamage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners couldresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legalclaims.\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personaldata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. Asapplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such astargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacyimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended bythe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentionalviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\\nand local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in productsand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data ofpersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing oftheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\\nchange our business practices.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer ofpersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validlytransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\\nUnited States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there isno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or areconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of\\ndoing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and datalocalization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessmentand approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of\\nsuch assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. Theinability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties\\nthat are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europeand/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedlyviolating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful ormay be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personaldata, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials andother statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or\\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation,enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\\n29'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that isinconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply withsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significantconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financialcondition.\\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expectedtax rates and other tax-related factors.\\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Althoughwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause otheradverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United\\nStates, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deductionis reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of\\nforeign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rulesannounced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted bycountries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countrieswith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles,adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for businesscombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for\\nstock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stockprice may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders\\nasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrencymining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetarydamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other\\nremedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome,litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy orfulfilling our contractual obligations.\\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or\\nrepurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all,which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from\\noperations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry andcompetitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability\\nto grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.\\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver fromthe note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared\\n30'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nimmediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future\\nfinancing and affect the terms of any such financing.\\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.\\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate of\\nincorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of ourBoard of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholderapproval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and\\nshareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreementwith Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of\\nrefusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult forshareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\\nItem 1B.

These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecuritythreats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard forInformation Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk\\nmanagement and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place\\ncybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to,mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity\\nrisks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designedto ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. We\\nroutinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additionalinformation, product, and physical security requirements.\\nRefer to “Item 1A.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for acceleratedcomputing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\\nOur two operating segments are \""Compute & Networking\"" and \""Graphics.\"" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications acrossseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply andcapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchasecommitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certaincomponents. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains\\nvery strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions orimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. Theserisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,\\ncreating additional supply chain complexity.\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and\\nsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AIopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing\\nlead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architecturesahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\\ncould result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of newproducts to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing ofcustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures\\nat the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform,\\nLLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue orsupply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such asgenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\n34'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nGlobal Trade\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply tothe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China marketin small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensingrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by thelicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on thelicense application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes inthe USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting ourbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including theMiddle East.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors– Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including\\u2009inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopoliticaldevelopments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify,\\nthese macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\u2009\\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 3,700\\nemployees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operatingexpenses in fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our\\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial number of our employees in the regionhave been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or othersmay continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to\\nour business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for ourbusiness.\\n35'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nFiscal Year 2024 Summary\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Change\\n($ in millions, except per share data)\\nRevenue $ 60,922 $ 26,974 Up 126%\\nGross margin 72.7 % 56.9 % Up 15.8 pts\\nOperating expenses $ 11,329 $ 11,132 Up 2%\\nOperating income $ 32,972 $ 4,224 Up 681%\\nNet income $ 29,760 $ 4,368 Up 581%\\nNet income per diluted share $ 11.93 $ 1.74 Up 586%\\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

As AV\\nalgorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA’s automotive data center processing demand to growsignificantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, largecloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers.

Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\\nand future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customerdemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-\\nparty manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve monthsfor some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums andprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates andjudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where weoperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded taxliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statementsaccordingly.\\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, andcertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assetsas income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n37\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue Allowances\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stockingdistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on\\nthe amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specificproducts and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accrualsinclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customercontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require asignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparablecircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, wedetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and testequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost ofrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or\\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024\\nand 2023, respectively.\\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, systemintegrators, AIB, and distributors.\\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have\\nrepresented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer\\nfabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with suchpurchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includesacquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel\\nassociated with manufacturing operations.\\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year increase was primarily due to strong Data\\nCenter revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.\\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Sales of previously reservedinventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023,\\nrespectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nOperating Expenses\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $Change %Change\\n ($ in millions)\\nResearch and development expenses $ 8,675 $ 7,339 $ 1,336 18 %\\n% of net revenue 14.2 % 27.2 %   \\nSales, general and administrative expenses 2,654 2,440 214 9 %\\n% of net revenue 4.4 % 9.1 %   \\nAcquisition termination cost — 1,353 (1,353) (100)%\\n% of net revenue — % 5.0 %\\nTotal operating expenses $ 11,329 $ 11,132 $ 197 2 %\\n% of net revenue 18.6 % 41.3 %\\nThe increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2024 was primarily driven by compensationand benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\\nAcquisition Termination Cost\\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at\\nsigning.\\n40'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $Change\\n ($ in millions)\\nInterest income $ 866 $ 267 $ 599 \\nInterest expense (257) (262) 5 \\nOther, net 237 (48) 285 \\nOther income (expense), net $ 846 $ (43) $ 889 \\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Income tax as a percentage of\\nincome before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year 2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was\\nresolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of areduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash taxpayments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research taxcredit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction,stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS auditresolution.\\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for a new 15% global minimum taxapplicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two\\nlegislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation onPillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is notexpected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. New legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\n41'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content=\""Table of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\\n (In millions)\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7,280 $ 3,389 \\nMarketable securities 18,704 9,907 \\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 25,984 $ 13,296 \\n Year Ended\\nJan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\\n (In millions)\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 28,090 $ 5,641 \\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (10,566)$ 7,375 \\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (13,633)$ (11,617)\\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certainmaturity limits on our portfolio.\\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to growth in revenue.

The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024and 2023.\\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange ratefluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively\\nimpact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising theirmanufacturing costs.\\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\\nrelated to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $116 million and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded inaccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when\\nrecognized.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on incomebefore taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other\\nincome (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedgecontracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nItem 8.

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absoluteassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\\nItem 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024,\\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the TreadwayCommission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\\n28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 inconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issuedby the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internalcontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal controlover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, andtesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n48\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated orrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities ofproducts, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\\nconditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventorypurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developingprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptionsrelated to future demand and market conditions.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excessproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\\nincluded, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchasecommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; andevaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to\\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and pastresults, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose,

Financial Statements\\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOur Company\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nAll references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances andtransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenueand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\\ntaxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, andother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five toseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating\\nexpenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic anddiluted share.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. Wedetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue isallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performanceobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\nProduct Sales Revenue\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Supportand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances forreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the timerevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketingdevelopment funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\\npartners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs forpotential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\\n55'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development servicesare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\\nSoftware Licensing\\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses arefrequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from softwarelicenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\\nas services are performed.\\nCloud Services\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over thecontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreementsindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone sellingprice basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstancesand to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\\nProduct Warranties\\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardwarecomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limitedcircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\\nor RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date ofgrant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\\nand market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUsis recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually andrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent andother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\\n56'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\\navailable that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate theloss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\\nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our ConsolidatedStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by taxjurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on availableevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may bedue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required torecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets thatmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extentrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical meritsof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share iscomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to becash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currentlyclassify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-saledebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\\nof shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale ofmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our ConsolidatedStatements of Income.\\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than itsamortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is\\nmore likely than not we will be required or\\n57'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nwe intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income\\n(expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short\\nmaturities as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value withthe related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value\\nof the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measuredat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Forderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of thegains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized inearnings.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accountsreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, andincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for\\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overallestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\\nInventories\\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consistprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. Wecharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future productpurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates anew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line methodbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost andaccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leasesare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating leaseassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowingrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.\\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\\n58'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content=\""Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completingour impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. \\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and marketvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economicfactors and the future profitability of our business. \\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired undertechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliablydetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held andused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for theamount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined basedon the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would nolonger be depreciated.\\nBusiness Combination\\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based ontheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\\nas goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherentlyuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing ofprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we mayrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our ConsolidatedStatements of Income.\\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments\\nin privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense),net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readilydeterminable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\\ntransactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactivemarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments,\\nrealized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternativebased on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n59\""), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant\\nexpenses in operating segments.

The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform ofunspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation\\naction.\\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\\nAs of January 28, 2024, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief\\nthat liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot bereasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no\\nassurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidityor financial position.\\n74'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)\\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\\nThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following:\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Jan 30, 2022\\n (In millions)\\nCurrent income taxes:    \\nFederal $ 5,710 $ 1,703 $ 482 \\nState 335 46 42 \\nForeign 502 228 71 \\nTotal current 6,547 1,977 595 \\nDeferred income taxes:    \\nFederal (2,499) (2,165) (420)\\nState (206) — — \\nForeign 216 1 14 \\nTotal deferred (2,489) (2,164) (406)\\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 4,058 $ (187)$ 189 \\nIncome before income tax consists of the following:\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Jan 30, 2022\\n (In millions)\\nU.S. $ 29,495 $ 3,477 $ 8,446 \\nForeign 4,323 704 1,495 \\nIncome before income tax $ 33,818 $ 4,181 $ 9,941 \\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows:\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Jan 30, 2022\\n (In millions, except percentages)\\nTax expense computed at federal statutory rate$ 7,102 21.0 % $ 878 21.0 % $ 2,088 21.0 %\\nExpense (benefit) resulting from:\\nState income taxes, net of federal tax effect 120 0.4 % 50 1.2 % 42 0.4 %\\nForeign-derived intangible income (1,408) (4.2)% (739) (17.7)% (520) (5.2)%\\nStock-based compensation (741) (2.2)% (309) (7.4)% (337) (3.4)%\\nForeign tax rate differential (467) (1.4)% (83) (2.0)% (497) (5.0)%\\nU.S. federal research and development tax credit (431) (1.3)% (278) (6.6)% (289) (2.9)%\\nAcquisition termination cost — — % 261 6.2 % — — %\\nIP domestication — — % — — % (244) (2.5)%\\nOther (117) (0.3)% 33 0.8 % (54) (0.5)%\\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 4,058 12.0 % $ (187) (4.5)% $ 189 1.9 %\\n75'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nThe tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\\n Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023\\n (In millions)\\nDeferred tax assets:  \\nCapitalized research and development expenditure $ 3,376 $ 1,859 \\nGILTI deferred tax assets 1,576 800 \\nAccruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 1,121 686 \\nResearch and other tax credit carryforwards 936 951 \\nNet operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 439 409 \\nOperating lease liabilities 263 193 \\nStock-based compensation 106 99 \\nProperty, equipment and intangible assets 4 66 \\nOther deferred tax assets 179 91 \\nGross deferred tax assets 8,000 5,154 \\nLess valuation allowance (1,552) (1,484)\\nTotal deferred tax assets 6,448 3,670 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:   \\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (502) (228)\\nOperating lease assets (255) (179)\\nAcquired intangibles (74) (115)\\nGross deferred tax liabilities (831) (522)\\nNet deferred tax asset (1) $ 5,617 $ 3,148 \\n(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $6.1 billion and $3.4 billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $462 million and $247 million for fiscal years\\n2024 and 2023, respectively.

It shall be binding and enforceable against\\nall Covered Officers and, to the extent required by the Compensation Recovery Rules, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\\nrepresentatives.\\nThis Policy amends and restates the Prior Policy with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Officer on and after the Effective\\nDate. The Prior Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive Compensation Received by a Covered Officer prior to the Effective Date.\\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, regardless of whether or when any restated financial statements are filed, the Company must reasonably promptly\\nrecover the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of\\nfault.\\nFor any compensation plans or programs involving Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall include the amount\\ncontributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive\\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\\ndirectly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the\\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable stock price or TSR. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\\nestimate and provide it to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\\nThe Company would not be required to recover Recoverable Incentive Compensation if (I) (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this\\nPolicy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, or (B) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) and regulations\\nthereunder and (II) the Committee (or in the absence of a Committee, a majority of the independent members of the Board) determines that recovery would be\\nimpracticable. However, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of\\nenforcement under (I)(A) of this paragraph, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive Compensation, document its\\nreasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and method for recovering Recoverable Incentive\\nCompensation, provided that the recovery is undertaken reasonably promptly. The Committee may, but is not limited to, seek recovery from a Covered Officer\\nfrom any or a combination of the following sources, irrespective of whether the applicable source of compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or\\npaid to the Covered Officer prior to, on, or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered\\nOfficer; (ii) cancelling or directing the return of prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or\\noffsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of any deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A;\\nand (v) any other method authorized by applicable\\nNVIDIA Corporation    Application: GlobalDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External            Page 1 of 5'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='        \\nCOMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\\nlaw or contract.

All Covered Officers are subject to this Policy pursuant to\\nthe terms as set forth in Exhibit A.\\nNothing in this Policy nor any recovery shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company may have against a Covered Officer. This Policy\\ndoes not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Officer’s obligations to the Company, including, without limitation, termination\\nof employment and/or institution of civil proceedings.\\nThis Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and\\nChief Financial Officer and to any other compensation recovery policy and/or similar provisions in any employment, equity plan, equity award or other individual\\nagreement to which the Company is a party or which the Company has adopted or may adopt and maintain from time to time; provided, that any amounts\\nalready recovered by or reimbursed to the Company under those requirements and provisions related to the same Accounting Restatement will be credited\\ntowards the amount of any Recoverable Incentive Compensation under this Policy, except as may be required by applicable law or listing standards.\\nAny action by the Company to recover or any recovery of Recoverable Incentive Compensation under this Policy from a Covered Officer shall not be deemed (i)\\n“good reason” for resignation or to serve as a basis for a claim of constructive termination under any benefits or compensation arrangements applicable to such\\nCovered Officer, or (ii) to constitute a breach of any contract or other arrangement to which such Covered Officer is a party.\\nCOMPLIANCE, VIOLATIONS and CONSEQUENCES\\nThe Company may be subject to delisting if it does not comply with this Policy.\\nADMINISTRATION, TERMINATION and AMENDMENT\\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, unless otherwise determined by a majority of the independent members of the Board. Any determination by\\nthe Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties and need not be uniform with respect to each individual\\ncovered by this Policy.

The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of Committee\\nmembers under applicable law or Company policy.\\nSubject to applicable law, the Committee may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions that the Committee, in\\nits sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy\\ninvolving such officer or employee).\\nNVIDIA Corporation    Application: GlobalDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External            Page 2 of 5'), Document(metadata={'source': './nvidia.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='        \\nCOMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\\nIf any provision of this Policy or the application of any provision to a Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,\\nsuch invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed\\namended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.\\nThe Committee may amend, terminate or replace this Policy or any portion of this Policy at any time in its sole discretion, and shall amend this Policy as it\\ndeems necessary to comply with applicable law or listing standards.\\nSpeak Up | Reporting Concerns\\nIf you are aware of a situation that may violate this Policy, you have a responsibility to report the incident to your immediate supervisor, Corporate Legal or to\\nNVIDIA-Compliance.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders\\' letter, \""Google is not a conventional company. \\nWe do not intend to become one.\"" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring \\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is \\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant \\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a \\nperson\\'s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve \\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products \\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion \\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across \\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a \\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first \\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n4.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across \\n133 languages in Google Translate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, \\nsuch as the Transformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language \\nunderstanding. This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped \\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For \\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, \\nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work \\non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful \\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial \\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time \\nflooding information to communities and individuals. \\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we \\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold \\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and \\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we \\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means \\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including \\ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we \\nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences \\nfor our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI P rinciples. We published \\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance \\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we \\nbelieve it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large \\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on \\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced \\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our \\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using \\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides \\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google \\nTranslate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features \\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally \\naccessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI \\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace \\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to \\ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. \\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image \\nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n5.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=\""We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their \\nbusinesses — and we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign \\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across \\nall of Google’s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, \\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are \\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and \\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as \\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome \\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences. \\nMoonshots\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, \\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. \\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to \\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term , most notably for the \\napplication of AI to our  products and services , as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing . As \\nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy and Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\\nphishing, and password security features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\nServing Our Users\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include  ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by \\nusers around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \\nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more \\nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more \\nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n6.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people \\naround the world to create and find great digital content.\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to \\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well \\nas growing our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people\\'s lives easier \\nby combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, \\nsuch as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on \\nevery day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\\nHow We Make Money\\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \\nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of \\nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\""Google Network \\nproperties\""). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n• Performance advertising  creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n• Brand advertising  helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, \\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \\ncampaigns. \\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\nIn addition, Google S ervices increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \\nincluding:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services , such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium,  and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \\nand\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other \\ncloud services. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\\n• AI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \\n• Cybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with \\nAI integrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack \\npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats. \\n• Databases and Analytics:  provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, in-\\nmemory — to store and manage data for different types of applications. Our Data Cloud also unifies data \\nlakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can \\nanalyze data across any cloud.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n7.

Alphabet’s \\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from \\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become \\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own \\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with \\nconsiderable uncertainty, s ome of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their \\nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n• general purpose search engines and information services;\\n• vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users \\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n• online advertising platforms and networks;\\n• other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n• digital content and application platform providers;\\n• providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n• developers and providers of AI products and services;\\n• companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\\n• providers of digital video services; \\n• social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \\nthrough traditional search engines;\\n• providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \\n• digital assistant providers.\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \\non attracting and retaining:\\n• users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n• advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n• content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n8.

Sustainability is one of \\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on \\nsustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago. \\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners \\nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of \\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to \\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain. \\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by \\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 \\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based \\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based \\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target. \\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy.  Since 2017, we \\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an \\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind \\nacross the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on \\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy \\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we \\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater \\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the \\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains.  Our \\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and \\npromoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including \\nGoogle’s Environmental Report.

RISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to \\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect \\nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a \\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \\nads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total  revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practice s, such as \\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies,  as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy \\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions  and entering into other strategic \\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent;  initiating intellectual property \\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the \\nneed for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company . This includes generative AI and continuing to \\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs \\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for \\nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party \\nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that \\nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \\nor sell our own AI products and services.\\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and \\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n11.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products \\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal \\nor better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting \\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services,  and technologies in a \\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services , reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our \\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also \\nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and \\nuncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different \\nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to \\nadequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and \\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market  with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.  There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \\ndevices that compete effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models \\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business \\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory \\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or \\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may \\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in \\nother countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among \\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time , and we may experience  downward pressure on our \\noperating margin in the future. \\nOur revenue growth rate  could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our \\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer \\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n12.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs \\nfor many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and \\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. W e may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base \\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue \\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, \\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \\nunenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \\n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have \\nruled that \""Google\"" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \\nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \\nresults. \\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures.  For example, if we fail to respond \\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \\nbrands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \\nrange of settings. \\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results. \\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \\nto supply both our products and our services. \\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking \\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to \\nassemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the  supply of components and \\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these \\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n13.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other \\nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them. \\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/\\nor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, \\nmanufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange \\nrates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing \\nrequirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change \\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial \\nor business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices \\nare available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms \\nin the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay \\ncritical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability. \\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \\nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \\nmay affect our supply. \\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \\noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \\nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \\ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \\nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \\nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our \\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications \\nfailures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service \\nattacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in \\nareas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, \\nsabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems \\nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. \\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The \\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data \\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical \\nand complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result \\nin interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from \\neffectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating \\nresults. \\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n14.

Although we \\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \\ndollar and foreign currencies  have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results. \\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation \\nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of  Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losse s or impairments we record from fair value \\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such \\ninvestments.  \\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \\nand operating results. \\nRisks Related to our Industry \\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \\nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables \\n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products \\nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical \\nstandards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited \\nfunctionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to \\ninclude our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n15.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter \\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue \\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. \\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and \\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues . As a \\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could \\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and \\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or \\nreputational harm. \\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement A I \\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant \\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nData privacy  and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \\nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks \\non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ \\nand customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, \\ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our \\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as \\nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive \\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches \\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other \\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products \\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and \\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features \\ninvolving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated \\nsecurity threats as our and the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to \\ndevelop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after \\nwe have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, \\nand/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our \\nreputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have \\noccurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there \\nis no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant \\nresources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or \\nbreaches. \\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect \\nour or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our \\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we \\nface the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our \\ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical \\ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n16.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in \\nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and \\nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a \\nlater date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the \\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage \\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all \\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be \\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our \\nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business \\npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures \\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be \\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may \\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could \\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities , including \\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or \\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to \\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, \\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related \\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of \\nour platforms and misuse of user data. \\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, \\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, \\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. \\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary \\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, \\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including \\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors \\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third \\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our \\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad \\npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading \\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we \\nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, \\nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There \\nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the \\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. \\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such \\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation \\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely \\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and \\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, \\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. \\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content \\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our \\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. \\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including \\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate \\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest \\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and \\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n17.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content=\""uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of \\nabuse for bad actors.\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in \\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have \\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam \\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their \\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our \\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative \\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in \\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, \\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve \\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from \\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including \\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten \\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation. \\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality \\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in \\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention. \\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet \\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and \\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products \\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant \\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable \\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers \\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user \\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our \\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors \\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet \\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For \\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit \\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In \\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or \\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or \\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby \\nnegatively affecting our business. \\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \\nto expand our business. \\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our \\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws \\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new \\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, \\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these \\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and \\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and \\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n• Competition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n18.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content=\""settlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies , fees, and \\nbusiness model; as well as litigation and new regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n• AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital \\nproducts and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while \\nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU \\nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other \\nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are \\nbased. In addition, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and \\nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate \\nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models. \\n• Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, \\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the \\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data \\ntransfers (including data localization laws). \\n• Copyright and other intellectual property : Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new \\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or  linked to from our platforms,  \\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, \\nwhich may result in other regulatory actions. \\n• Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\\n• Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, \\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For \\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 \\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for \\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe \\nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals \\nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \\nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including \\nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, \\nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, \\nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm \\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders \\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We  are also subject to a variety of claims including \\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, \\nand we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental \\neffects, AI training, development, and commercialization , or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, \\nand we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and \\ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal \\ntheories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our \\nproducts and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to \\ncontent created by third parties. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n19.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content=\""For example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google \\nviolated antitrust laws related to Google Play's billing practices. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 \\nand the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, \\nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, \\nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the \\noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and \\naround the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have \\nchallenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are \\ncooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate. \\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past , \\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing \\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations , including \\ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, \\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity \\nand other harms to our business.

The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, \\nadditional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, \\nfinancial condition, and operating results. \\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal \\nProceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure \\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results. \\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation \\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have \\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, \\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and \\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products \\nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include: \\n• The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which \\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or \\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or \\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\\n• Various comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their \\nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting \\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose \\nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\\n• State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy \\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that \\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information. \\n• Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to \\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the \\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of \\nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on \\nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children. \\n• The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with \\ninternet-connected devices.\\n• The EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data \\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among \\nother changes. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n20.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Further, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances \\nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory \\nauthorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data.  The validity of various data transfer mechanisms  we \\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which \\nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, \\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to \\nuse certain technologies. \\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \\nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and \\nreputational harm. \\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those \\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and \\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are \\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven \\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting \\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and \\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in \\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious,  and may change. \\nWe cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and \\nprojects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate . Any failure, or perceived failure, by \\nus to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or \\nmeet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or \\nexposure to additional tax liabilities. \\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. \\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with \\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk \\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the \\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax \\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws).

'), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content=\""unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For \\nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital \\nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax \\nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among \\nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, \\nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. O ur effective tax rate and cash tax \\npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could \\ndiminish our cash reserves. \\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. \\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our \\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately  51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common \\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \\naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \\nstockholders may consider favorable. \\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n• Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n• Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \\na stockholders' meeting.\\n• Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of \\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n22.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content=\""• Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to \\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter \\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or \\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \\n• Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, \\nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \\npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. \\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware \\nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting \\nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved \\nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, \\nincluding, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around \\nthe world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C \\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \\nGeneral Risks \\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \\nresults to fall short of expectations. \\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \\noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \\n• diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \\nother strategic arrangements; \\n• failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions \\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or \\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n• failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \\n• implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \\ncompany; \\n• integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n• transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \\ncountries; \\n• failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \\nand other strategic arrangements;\\n• failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n23.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark \\ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, \\nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated \\nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions \\nand other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated \\nliabilities, and harm our business generally. \\nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, \\nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased \\nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In \\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \\npotential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \\nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \\noperate effectively. \\nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \\nwell as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \\nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \\nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \\nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \\nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \\nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \\nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \\nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration \\npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our \\nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance \\npolicies.\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \\ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \\ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \\ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may \\nexperience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and \\nmaintain our corporate culture. \\nITEM 1B.

Discussion of 2022 results \\ncompared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K.\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For \\nadditional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15  of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\\n• Users\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may \\naffect our revenues.\\n• Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, \\nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or \\nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to \\nmaintain and grow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within  the global smartphone market, such as increased market \\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\""TAC rate\"") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n• As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \\nmonetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to \\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, \\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also \\nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Searc h, that could affect our \\nmonetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then \\non monetization.\\n• As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \\nrates affect such revenues. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n29.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \\nrevenues from emerging markets.  We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \\nand earnings.\\n• The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \\non our advertising revenues.  For example,  sales of our devices  adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n• As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \\ncapital expenditures.\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, a nd rapidly and responsibly deploy AI  across our \\nbusinesses. We also expect to  increase, relative to 2023 , our investmen t in our technical infrastructure, including \\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \\nparticular in support of AI products and services . In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the \\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong \\npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\\n• We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \\nfinancial results.\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws  and policies governing a wide \\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we \\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the \\nantitrust complaints filed by  the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative \\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor \\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various \\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk \\nFactors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n• Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\\nOur employees are among our best assets  and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue \\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs.

When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n43.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating \\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \\nis made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \\nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.

Certain of these matters \\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss  in Note 10 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \\nand equity investment risks. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen.  For the \\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \\nexperienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and \\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset \\nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approxima tely $136 million  and $503 million  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \\nforeign currency exchange rates.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot \\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to \\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately  $1.3 billion  and  $1.5 billion  lower as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million \\nlower as of December 31, 2022  and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that w ill allow us to preserve capital and \\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n45.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='We use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value \\nof our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for \\nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with \\n95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, \\n2022 and 2023 are shown below (in millions):\\n As of December 31,\\n12-Month Average \\nAs of December 31,\\n 2022 2023 2022 2023\\nRisk category - interest rate $ 256 $ 296 $ 198 $ 271 \\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the \\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with \\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is \\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \\nrepresent $5.2 billion  and $6.0 billion  of our investments as of December 31, 2022  and 2023, respectively. A \\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023  balance would decrease the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, \\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \\n2022 and 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. \\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments \\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1  and Note 3  of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n46.

We are a public accounting firm registered with \\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial \\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion \\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter \\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n48.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content=\""Loss Contingencies \\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nother proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and \\nsecurity, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content \\ngenerated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their \\nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations \\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on \\nthe financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n50.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\""Alphabet\"") became \\nthe successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as  fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolid ated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values \\nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment,  among \\nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, \\nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those \\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per \\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable.  Sales and other \\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n• Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n• YouTube properties; and\\n• Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement . For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n56.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube \\nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n• platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n• devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n• other products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report \\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to \\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n• Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n• Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google \\nWorkspace; and\\n• other enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and  amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n• TAC includes: \\n◦ amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \\nand software developers; and\\n◦ amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n57.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='• Other cost of revenues includes:\\n◦ compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦ content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers \\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦ depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦ inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software \\ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. \\nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs \\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation \\nStock-based compensation (SBC)  primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies . PSUs and \\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies  are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \\nrespective Other Bet company.\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred.  For the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021 , 2022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2 \\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\\nPerformance Fees\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\\nFair Value Measurements \\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that \\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and \\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based \\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active \\nmarkets.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n58.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all \\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, \\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of O ther Bet companies, and \\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable.  We manage our credit risk exposure \\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. \\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts \\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. \\nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the \\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E.  We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n59.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content=\""changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the \\nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach  as of the transaction date and are \\nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \\ncustomer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \\nconditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time.  For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \\nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\nInventory\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n60.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content='or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, \\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the \\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. \\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally \\nover a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter \\nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information \\ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our \\nintended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \\nand liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts  primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nterm.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets,  excluding goodwill, for impairment when \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected \\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n61.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization  of our \\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for \\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ \\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction \\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \""Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\"" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses.

The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 \\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019 ) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, \\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge \\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\\n• In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in \\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n• On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, \\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology \\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General \\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's \\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. \\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that \\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on \\nDecember 1, 2023.\\n• On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Pla y violated U.S. \\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated \\nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May \\n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean \\nregulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's \\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations. \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously . We continue to \\ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n78.  \""), Document(metadata={'source': './google.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content=\""Privacy Matters \\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to  a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and \\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and \\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement  lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, \\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our \\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.  For example, in December 2023, a California \\njury delivered a verdict in  Epic Games v. Google  finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's \\nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We \\nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could \\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our \\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other \\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.

Stockholders' Equity \\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share.

Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share \\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock \\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of \\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per \\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to \\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a \\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In \\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it \\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.

We \\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or \\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for \\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial \\nstatements.\\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the \\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax \\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. \\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are \\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for \\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is \\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. \\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million  in the next 12 months.
